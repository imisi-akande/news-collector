Politics,"Stop Demonising Political Opponents, Dissenters, NANS Tells Nigerian Government","4 Months Ago
",/2020/01/02/stop-demonising-political-opponents-dissenters-nans-tells-nigerian-government,"
 
 The National Association of Nigerian Students, Zone D (South West), has called on the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to stop demonising political opponents and persons with dissenting voices in the country. The group, which described 2019 as the worst year for Nigeria’s democracy, said that in 2020 and the years ahead, the All Progressives Congress-led government must show more commitment to upholding the rule of law by respecting the views of all citizens. In a statement jointly signed by Coordinator, NANS Zone D, Kowe Odunayo Amos, Secretary-General, Giwa Yisa Temitope, Public Relations Officer, Kazeem Olalekan Israel, the students’ body said that it would put up a new level of resistance against rising fascism and anti-poor policies by the government henceforth. The statement reads, “It is high-time we spoke some truths to ourselves and critically look at where we are as a nation. “After considering the leadership qualities of President Muhammadu Buhari, it is disheartening to note that the score sheet does not differ from that of his predecessors. “Ever since the mantle of leadership fell on Buhari, he has proven to be the new squanderer and dasher of the hope of the people of Nigeria; rigging of elections has been at its peak, political persecution, media trial of perceived opponents, the demonisation of dissenters, the destruction of the economy and the humiliation of the people of Nigeria especially those in the Northern part of the country by Boko Haram. “It is disgusting and embarrassing that the government of Nigeria that swore to defend and protect the lives and properties of the citizens has subjected the people especially those in the Northern part of the country to violence, butchery and subversion in the hands of Boko Haram. “It would however, not be out of place to call 2019 the worst year in the history of Nigeria's democracy. “Indeed, the journey to nationhood and democracy has been so tortuous especially during this change era. We have witnessed unprecedented mass murder and barbarity by well-armed Fulani vampires in the Northern part of the country without government taking action to bring these vampires to book. We have witnessed gross disobedience of court orders with the executive arm turning itself to arbiter of justice. “In truth, the change has being from darkness to loom and bad to worst. “We urge this government to fight terrorism, combat corruption to the minimum level, secure lives and properties of the people, fulfil campaign promises, provide jobs for the youth, secure the economy and deal with indecency in high-places while adhering strictly to the rule of law. “The Nigerian people must also stop lionising the saboteurs of our national wealth that are living large at our own detriment. “We must also be ready to take our leaders by their promises while demanding accountability.” "

Corruption,Discontent In NDDC Over Illegal Promotion Exercise For Select Staff,"2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/15/discontent-nddc-over-illegal-promotion-exercise-select-staff,"There is currently discontent in the Niger Delta Development Commission following an illegal promotion of staff without regard for public service rules. A source at the NDDC, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said no promotion examination or appraisal was done before the promotion was conducted. “The last promotion conducted by the commission was for staff due for promotion in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. Immediately this was concluded, promotion letters for successful staff in the first cadre were issued to them immediately. “Promotion letters for successful staff in the second cadre were also released in the last week of April 2020, specifically from 27th to 30th. 
 
 “However to our surprise, on Tuesday 5th of May, 2020, another set of promotion letters without any form of exams or given criteria were issued to some special staff of the NDDC. “Some had a single promotion, and some had a double promotion. The effective dates of promotion were 1st of May 2020,” the source said. A document seen by SaharaReporters revealed that the promotion exercise was illegal as it ran contrary to the code and statutes establishing the commission and flagrant abuse of Rule 020701 of the Public Service Rules, which requires that senior officers must spend a minimum of three years on a post before being considered eligible for the promotion. According to NDDC rules, staff from grade level 8 to 14 must spend a minimum of three years on a post before being considered for promotion while those from level 15 to 17 can only be considered after spending four years on a post. Some of those who benefited from the illegal promotion include Peter Ebe (Finance), Silas Anyanwu (Human Resources), Charles Akpan (Administration), Chucks Osuji (CID), Godwin Ogedegbe (EDP’s office), Mr Gbenga (EDP’s office) and Alphonsus Fiderikumo (Finance). Others are Eno Obi (Audit), Henry Effiong (Finance), Arit Worika (Human Resources) and Okowa Pinnaebi (Human Resources). Recall that the NDDC had been rocked by an N5bn COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment fraud, leading to national outrage and federal lawmakers summoning the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, to explain what was going on in the agency. Calls for a probe of the agency have not ceased with many observers describing the NDDC as a cesspit of corruption."

Opinion,We Are All Atheists By Leo Igwe,"4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/we-are-all-atheists-leo-igwe,"It is now over two weeks since police detectives arrested Nigerian atheist, Mubarak Bala in Kaduna in Northern Nigeria. His arrest was in connection with posts that he made on Facebook. The petitioners said that the posts insulted the prophet of Islam, Muhammad. Mr. Bala was transferred to Kano the following day but since then his whereabouts are unknown. He has been held incommunicado without access to a lawyer and family members. The police have not charged him in court.  Meanwhile, there have been reports that a list of atheists, to be arrested and arraigned alongside Mr. Bala, is being compiled. There is an ongoing witch hunt for atheists, especially in Northern Nigeria. One source said that these were atheists who had allegedly made comments that insulted Muhammad or posted comments that annoyed Muslims.  Some atheists have received calls from strange numbers or from unknown individuals who tried to confirm their identities. Most atheists in Nigeria are in the closet due to fear of being persecuted or killed by extremists. The situation is worse and more dangerous in Northern Nigeria where sharia law is in force in most states. Until recently, the atheist movement in the region has been underground. However, there has been growing visibility of atheism in Northern Nigeria since Mubarak came out as an atheist in 2014. 
 
 The emergence of atheism in the region has worried Muslim leaders. And last year an Islamic institute organized a seminar to discuss the disturbing trend of Atheism and Social Media. Following the arrest of Mubarak Bala, there have been numerous threats to expose and deal with other atheists. But those Muslims who are trying to clamp down on the atheist movement have not thought it through. It may not have occurred to them that they too are atheists. In this piece, I argue that we are all atheists because atheism entails a lack of belief in a god or gods. And everybody is an atheist in relation to one god or another. My submission is that if we are all atheists, why are some Muslims in Northern Nigeria persecuting fellow atheists? Why do they want to deny other atheists their rights to life, freedom of conscience, expression, and association? First, let's establish how Muslims are atheists or unbelievers. Muslims believe in Allah and in that sense, they are theists. They are believers. There is no doubt about it. However Muslim relationship to the god idea does not end with the belief in Allah. In Islam, there is this saying: “There is no other god but Allah”. Take note, “no other god”. This statement is an affirmation of belief in god as well as a declaration of disbelief in other gods. So concerning other gods, Muslims are atheists. Muslims are “unbelievers”. They are infidels. Like atheists, Muslims do not believe in the Christian god. They do not have faith in Zeus, Vishnu, Osiris, Amadioha, Sango, Ogun, Urim, Tsumburburra, Haptu, and thousands of other gods that human beings have worshipped throughout history.   The difference between Muslims and other atheists is that other atheists go one god further in their disbelief. They do not believe in the Allah-god. So all Muslims are atheists, even though all atheists are not Muslims. And to make a clearer distinction between Muslims and other atheists, Believers in the Allah-god will be described as Muslim atheists. In Nigeria, Muslim atheists exercise their rights to freedom of belief and unbelief- their freedom to believe in Allah/prophet Muhammad and to unbelieve in Urim and Ogun. Muslims exercise their right to freedom of expression including their right to express their belief in Allah and their unbelief in other gods such as Odin and Krishna. In declaring their unbelief in other gods, muslims atheists make and could make statements that others could considers to be insulting, provoking and annoying. In seeking to penalize Mubarak and other atheists for statements and sentiments, posts, and comments that they made on Facebook, Muslim atheists are trying to deny other atheists the same rights that they enjoy. That is not fair. Is it? This inequity has been central to the entrenched Islamic privilege in Nigeria. This injustice has escaped the minds of those who are persecuting Mubarak Bala and other atheists in the region. Blinded by their theism, and forgetful of their atheism, Muslims who are threatening to kill and deal with atheists need to realize that atheists are human beings and the rights of atheists are human rights. More importantly, Muslims in Nigeria need to know that they are atheists too; that they belong to the family of unbelievers and infidels.  Yes, we are all atheists!"

Finance,"N4bn Discovered Inside 'Secret' Ondo Government Account, Lawmakers Demand Explanation From Executive","3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/n4bn-discovered-inside-secret-ondo-government-account-lawmakers-demand-explanation,"A total of N4.3bn stashed in a 'secret' Zenith Bank account belonging to the Ondo State Government has been discovered, SaharaReporters learnt. The money is said to have been kept in the account for over 10 years, generating interest until it was uncovered during an auditing of the state accounts recently.  It was gathered that the bank account was active during the administration of former governor, Olusegun Mimiko.  However, details of transactions carried out on the account remained sketchy at the time of this report. 
 
 A lawmaker in the state confirmed the discovery of the account in a chat with our correspondent, noting that the fund in it was lodged without due process, thereby raising some suspicions of corruption by some government officials.  The lawmaker disclosed that the money was discovered through the efforts of the Commissioner for Fiance in the state, Mr Wale Akinterinwa. He said, ""We learnt that the money had been kept in that account for over 10 years and was recently discovered due to auditing carried out on bank accounts belonging to the government. ""The most suspicious of it all was that this particular money was lodged in the bank account without following due process.  ""And of particular interest to us is about the authorisation of this account or who and who are the signatories to it.  ""We all want to know when the account was opened and what has also been the interest rate accurable to government since then."" Bamidele Oleyelogun, Speaker of Ondo State House Assembly, confirmed the discovery of the 'secret' account.  Oleyelogun said the Assembly was worried over the account but had already summoned the Accountant-General and Auditor-General of the state to report before the lawmakers for explanations on the discovery He said, ""The Commissioner for Finance has come here and told us his own side mostly on how the account was discovered.  ""So, we would be expecting the two men too to come over and probably furnish the Assembly with details of transactions on this account."""
Opinion,"Of Orji Kalu, Of Inequality Before The Law By Peniela E. Akintujoye Esq.","4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/orji-kalu-inequality-law-peniela-e-akintujoye-esq,"The already thirteen year old trial of former governor Orji Uzor Kalu of Abia State is to recommence for another twenty years probably. EFCC by now is looking to regather its 19 witnesses for a fresh cruise. That case if it ever returns to court will burden afresh the already overburdened cause list all at the expense of tax payers the umpteenth time.  Ours is a ""fast-becoming-useless"" legal system that aids criminality, thrives on senseless technicalities and brandishes an uncaring mediocrity to obfuscate the real triumph of the rule of law that we are always quick to pay lip services to.  We currently do not have any provisions in our laws that are sensible enough to appreciate the need for a trial judge who has just been promoted to the appellate court to conclude his pending trials before taking a fresh oath of office since we are a nation of incessant abandoned projects. He immediately leaves and all the trials he is presiding over no matter how advanced the stages they already are will have to commence de novo (afresh). How can this ever make sense to sensible people?  
 
 The Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015's attempt to cure this malady (of trials starting afresh due to promotion of the trial judge to the Court of Appeal) through its S. 396(7) (permitting the Judge to continue to sit to conclude those partly heard trials in his former court despite his new appointment at the Court of Appeal) by virtue of this Kalu (Udeogu's) case has effectively been sent to the grave. Admittedly, the provision offends the 1999 constitution (which is the highest law of the land) and may have been rightly thrown out. But then, the problem remains, pointing to the weakness of the constitution itself. No matter how well conducted your trial is and no matter the number of years spent, if the presiding judge is promoted, he abandons the case immediately without any thought- no thought about the lingering pain of the victim of the offense or that of the litigants in civil causes who cannot wait for the torturous trial to be over so they can get justice; no thought about the economic implication of a long trial on their plans and aspirations and ultimately their life which may be totally put on hold while the trial lasts; no thought about the rigour of trial on counsel and litigants alike and the cost of it both financially and emotionally.  All of these mean nothing to our unjust and uncaring justice system. Your matter starts de novo. It's as if that mouth with which someone flippantly says ""de novo"" should catch fire.  By then, you may have become totally fatigued, some of your key witnesses already dead and then you go home empty handed considering yourself more miserable for attempting to uphold your right in the first place. And that's how a system established to advance justice in a rather ironic twist of fate is now a key player in the vanguard of injustice.   How should it be possible in a sane clime for there to be sufficient systemic loopholes for anyone who has some little cash to frustrate the course of justice through frivolous appeals on even the most unreasonable grounds up to the Supreme Court. Orji Uzor Kalu for instance had successfully delayed his original trial by nine years through a frivolous interlocutory appeal up to the Supreme Court regarding the charges filed against him. We are the ones who created such a retrogressive system.  As the legal system is currently constituted, it is just too easy for an opponent to frustrate the course of justice or the fruit of someone's well deserved judgement out of malice to the highest levels. He only needs an ordinary sheet of paper titled ""Notice of Appeal"" no matter how incoherent his grounds or how bad his English and then he is sure to enjoy the fruit of his injustice for another eight years during which status quo must remain and that's if the appeal gets listed for hearing in eight years.  The way we talk years in the Nigerian legal system, you'll think they are equal to days. Sad! How can this be a system? How are the leaders able to sleep watching this kind of unjust system remain?  But it will interest you that it took just about five months for Mr. Udeogu (acting in effect for himself and his co-convict Kalu) to move from the Federal High Court up to the Supreme Court in his most recent appeal. It takes an average of 20 years for ordinary Nigerians to move up the same ladder. Ordinarily, what we were taught in law school was that a cardinal principle of the rule of law is equality before the law. That is a ruse here in Nigeria.  The rich and ruling class have created for themselves an express way to justice or to injustice depending on which of the two is needed at any material time. I know they'll tell us that Kalu's matter was of an urgent nature because it involved the liberty of a citizen but there are thousands of other citizens who are in the same prison as Kalu or Udeogu for far lesser offences who have not even been convicted but yet they remain in prison for many years. Why is Kalu's or Udeogu's different? Men who stole billions of their people's money at the expense of roads, schools and hospitals? What is so urgent about helping them to escape the consequences of their offences?    The same ruling elites who have refused to reform the justice system know by their own experience that it is insane, for want of a more gory descriptive, for a litigant to wait for 20 years to get justice in just one case. Which human can confidently boast that he will even be alive in another 20 years from now? Our position at the Civic Engagement and Justice Coalition (CJC) has always been that all cases are urgent. Enough of the rubbish of claiming some cases are urgent while some are not. A litigant whose livelihood depends on a land wrongfully taken from him by someone mightier than himself urgently needs justice in that case for the restoration of his livelihood but our legal system says land matters are not urgent for instance. What an upside way of thinking. It is the person who wears the shoe that knows where it hurts.  Our position is that we cannot continue to have this current legal system. It has suffered a reversal of fate. All people of conscience must rise in defense of true justice, the poor and the downtrodden. There is no justice if it is not gotten on time. It is worse if some in the same society can pay their way up while others because of their economic status have to wait long torturous years.  We need to proliferate our courts in direct proportion to population increase. We need far more divisions of the Court of Appeal than we currently have and let proliferation be based on a population quota system (It doesn't make sense for instance that Ekiti State has one panel of Justices sitting in its Court of Appeal while Lagos which has ten times the population of Ekiti has two sitting panels). This is why some appeals can be concluded within a year or two in Ekiti whereas it takes an average of 6-8 years to conclude same in Lagos inside the same country.  There is need for the unbundling of the Supreme Court into Six Zones to start with and sufficient number of Justices must be appointed for dispatch handling of cases. In the future, and in the spirit of true federalism, let each state have its own appellate system like we have in a nation like the United States of America where we copied our Federalism. Nobody should tell us it's not possible. Only mediocres make such statements. If we have the political will as a nation, we can easily get this done.  Somehow we have to fix this moribund system however we want to go about it. And it has to be now. It shouldn't any longer be a misfortune to be a Nigerian. Worse still, to be a poor Nigerian.  ""You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbour."" Leviticus 19:15. ESV.  END. "
Music,"Imo Police Deny Duncan Mighty Kidnap News, Say Musician Was Arrested For Fraud","5 Months Ago
",/2019/12/14/imo-police-deny-duncan-mighty-kidnap-news-say-musician-was-arrested-fraud,"
 
   The police in Imo State has debunked the news that musician, Duncan Okechukwu popularly known as Duncan Mighty, was kidnapped. In a post on Instagram, Duncan Mighty’s friend and billionaire club-owner, Cubana Chief Priest, had said, “He was beaten and abducted by the gunmen amid gunshots.” But denying that claim, the police in Imo in a statement on Saturday by its spokesperson, Ikeokwu Godson, said the artiste was in fact arrested for fraud and was not kidnapped by anyone. The statement reads, “Today 14/12/19, operatives of the command arrested popular music artiste, Duncan Mighty on an allegation of fraud. “This followed a petition written by an upcoming rap artiste M2, who claimed that the Imo State Government under Rochas Okorocha, through the office of the SA on Entertainment, entered into a deal with Duncan Mighty to manage, promote, arrange collaboration with other top artistes and sign M2 under Young Wealth record label owned by Duncan Mighty. “As a result, an agreement was reached with a fee of N11m was paid to him. “However, since collecting the payment, he refused to fulfill his own part of the deal. “Sequel to the petition, the artiste was arrested and he affirmed having such agreement and collecting the fund. “He said he can only refund the money if the contract was terminated. He was released on bail on self-recognisance. “Consequently, a letter was reviewed by the representative of the former governor terminating the contract to enable him refund the money. “Since then he absconded, and all efforts made to reach him proved abortive. “In view of the above, a warrant of arrest was issued, that led to his arrest in the early hours of this morning.”  "
Opinion,Enter The President’s New Chief Of Staff By Femi Fani-Kayode,"4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/enter-president%E2%80%99s-new-chief-staff-femi-fani-kayode,"200 years ago the Aare Kakanfo of the ancient Oyo Empire and the self-proclaimed Oba of Ilorin, Aare Afonja, rebelled against the Alaafin of Oyo and entered into a military alliance with a Fulani advisor, sorcerer and mercenary by the name of Alimi.  Predictably Alimi betrayed him and he ended up being tortured, dethroned and murdered. Not only did Alimi and his Fulani warriors kill him but they also murdered all his sons in the most cruel and barbaric fashion.  Alimi and his family took the throne for themselves and consequently the Oyo Empire, and by extension the Oduduwa nation, lost Ilorin to the Fulani and to the sons of Usman Dan Fodio.  
 
 Ever since that day a Fulani Emir, from Alimi's ""Gambari"" family and lineage, armed with a flag and staff of authority from the Sultan of Sokoto, has ruled Ilorin.  There is no gainsaying the fact that the Gambaris are trusted servants and bonded slaves of the Sokoto Caliphate.  They see themselves as the guardians, protectors and defenders of the Caliphate's southern border and they serve and protect its traditions, its faith and its political and economic interests. This has been the case for the last 200 years.  It is for this reason that they are often referred to by the sons and daughters of Oduduwa as 'mesu jamba' (meaning a ""shifty, unreliable and treacherous"").  To add to that, the saying goes ""beware of the Gambaris and the descendants of Alimi"".  Enter Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, Buhari's new Chief of Staff and Nigeria's former representative at the United Nations. Contrary to popular belief and despite his second name, ""Agboola"", this man is NOT a son of the south west or an Oduduwan but a Fulani Prince from the Royal house in Ilorin.  He is a descendant of Alimi. He is a Gambari. And to cap it all his brother, Emir Ibrahim Kolapo Sulu- Gambari, is the present Emir of Ilorin. His forefathers stole our sacred Oduduwan lands, took our throne, carved up and divided our Empire, enslaved our people and have persecuted our leaders in Ilorin for the last 200 years denying them of their most basic liberties and rights.  And worse of all they have done this with the full blessing and support of the Sokoto Caliphate and the Sultan of Sokoto.  Wlith the appointment of Gambari as the President's Chief of Staff, for the first time in our history, we have a Fulani President and a Fulani Chief of Staff both serving a Fulani Government with a Fulani agenda.  This has never happened before and very soon the results will be self-evident. To make matters worse Gambari is himself a hardliner and he was Buhari's Foreign Minister in 1984 when the latter was military Head of State. He served a tyrant and a dictator before and he is serving a tyrant and a dictator again.  And he served not just ANY tyrant and dictator but Nigeria's greatest military tyrant and dictator and now he is set to serve Nigeria's greatest civilian tyrant and dictator.  Unlike his predecessor in office the late Abba Kyari who was a Shuwa Arab, Gambari is a Fulani. His only interest throughout his distinguished career as a career diplomat was to do nothing but further and protect the interest and hegemonic agenda of the Caliphate in Nigeria and to justify and rationalise its greed, brutality, barbarity and excesses before the civilised world in various international fora. Now he has come to help estsblish and entrench Buhari's Islamisation and Fulanisation agenda. We welcome him and we will engage him in battle.  Abba Kyari has gone. A hardline Islamic fundamentalist and Fulani irredentist has now taken over his job. Nigerians will see the difference.  For those of us that have been in the struggle to liberate our people from the tyranny of Buhari for the last five years it is ""game on"" and ""back to the trenches"". The ceasefire is over and the war against ethnic and religious bondage and against injustice, subjugation, domination, nepotism, servitude and slavery has started again. May the best man win."
Opinion,"Ibrahim Gambari, PH1 (Public Hypocrite No. 1) By Okpia Egbe ","4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/ibrahim-gambari-ph1-public-hypocrite-no-1-okpia-egbe,"First, let me express agreement with Professor Ibrahim Gambari, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Envoy who has characterized Nigeria’s leaders as “hypocritical.” As Guest Speaker at the Justice Akanbi Foundation anniversary in Abuja, Gambari said that Nigeria leaders merely pay lip service to governance. He is right, and many other Nigerians say the same thing everyday. The difference is that they are not in a position to do anything about it. Regrettably, there is a category of Nigerians that are in a position to do something, but never do. I would say they are worse than hypocritical Nigerian leaders. I would call them Champions of Hypocrisy, and among them, nominate Gambari to be the Champion of Champions. Let us remember: in the 1980s and 1990s, Ibrahim Gambari served as Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Minister, and as Permanent Representative of Nigeria at the United Nations. Leading the governments he served were Ibrahim Babangida (IBB), widely-known as the man who has nurtured corruption the most in Nigeria, and as one who has vastly benefited from it. Does Gambari want to convince Nigerians he never benefited from IBB? If not, why has he never criticized the man? IBB snuffed out an election that Moshood Abiola had fairly and clearly won. What did this professor of Political Science, this “critic” of hypocrisy, say to IBB? Nothing. But it was during the regime of Sani Abacha that Gambari really established his credentials. As an opportunist, he joined an elite team that provided intellectual and international nourishment for Abacha. They did everything to convince Abacha that his brutal and duplicitous regime was on the right course. Indeed, Gambari told the world: “Nigerians don’t need democracy because democracy is not food. It is not their priority.” As Nigeria’s Permanent Representative at the United Nations—even as Nigeria became an international pariah and that organization sought an answer to the situation—Gambari defended Abacha smoothly and eloquently.  The more we were ostracized, the more he appeared on powerful international television stations, notably CNN, to offer justifications for the indefensible actions of Abacha. Are we to assume that Abacha is now one of those leaders he describes as hypocritical? Let us also remember that even after Abacha murdered Ken Saro-Wiwa and other environmental champions, Gambari did not identify any hypocrisy. In fact, he stated that Saro-Wiwa was a “common criminal.” In other words, that Abacha’s trial had been fair and within the rule of law.
 
 It is this same Gambari that says Nigerian leaders are hypocritical. Beyond IBB and Abacha, he has not criticized Olusegun Obasanjo, either. Obasanjo is known to have violated Nigeria’s hopes and dreams for eight years, but Gambari has not criticized him.   He cannot join the chorus of those who say the man should be probed. Do you wonder why? If you wonder, I have an answer: in his eyes Obasanjo could not have been bad because Gambari is a major beneficiary of Obasanjo’s farce. Remember the scandal over the sale of highbrow Ikoyi homes that led to the fall of the Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Mobolaji Osomo? Ibrahim Gambari was one of the two big winners. In the statement by which Obasanjo hoped to be mistaken for a corruption fighter, Obasanjo said: “I have a document sent to me anonymously…where 207 people had been allocated or offered land/property for sale surreptitiously; some with full payment, some with deposit and some without payment at all. I also feel personally embarrassed that almost all members of my wife's family are on that list. As it is, the entire list will now be cancelled without fail, the money collected should be refunded and all the property will be advertised for sale, except those allocated to Ambassador Ibrahim Gambari and Chief Emeka Anyaoku which had been approved long before this exercise…” What this story means is that for most of 22 years, from 1983 to 2007, Nigeria’s most infamous and vile leaders are people Gambari was pleased to serve, and glad to take from. He shamelessly seized his opportunities and never said ‘No’, to any of them. In public, Gambari is known for his charming, ingratiating style. He likes to make people feel that he is open and humble. But he is as personally hypocritical as he is politically fake, and this is what makes him such a sad and dangerous study. He has no principles. Think about it: he spent his years under Abacha strongly justifying that dictatorship and its odious policies. Today, following his service of a Ghanaian democrat, Gambari is in the service of a Korean democrat. That Gambari lacks principles is obvious in the fact that he is trying to convince a military regime in Myanmar that democracy is the right thing to do. At the UN, they really M.O.P(… advertisement have a weird sense of humor, don’t they? But Gambari does not mind being laughed at; last year, he wanted to become president of Nigeria, using his UN gig as a platform. It is clear that Gambari’s an unscrupulous, egotistical man. He will say anything at any time, depending on the audience and his personal goals. He is a serial salesman who, for the right price, would sell the UN just as easily as he betrayed Nigerians to IBB, Abacha and Obasanjo. Thus, at the Justice Akanbi foundation lecture, he was simply playing his normal game: the game of convenience. He spoke of the hypocrisy of Nigerian leaders—no names and specifics, please!—because he thought it would make him sound good before Nigerians, without offending anyone. No names—after all, who knows who might invite him to another powerful office tomorrow? Yes, Nigerian leaders are hypocritical, but the most hypocritical Nigerians are people like Ibrahim Gambari who have spent most of their careers propping them up, and serving and praising them. They share in all the spoils only to find a whisper in which to offer self-serving criticism. If political prostitution were banned, Gambari would never accept to speak before a Nigerian audience.  I am not close to Gambari, but I know his type well. When it matters, they do nothing to help Nigerians. In public, they will smile and shake hands broadly, hoping nobody can see through them. All hypocrites are the same, Gambari, but some are more hypocritical than others. For the championship, you have no competition. Please step forward and accept your prize. "
Opinion,Supreme Court Also Sits As A High Court! By Femi Falana (SAN),"4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/supreme-court-also-sits-high-court-femi-falana-san,"In the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria delivered on May 9, 2020 in the case of Ude Jones Udeogu v Federal Republic of Nigeria (unreported Appeal No SC. 662C/2019), section 396 (7) of Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 was declared illegal and unconstitutional. The section had empowered a newly appointed Justice of the Court of Appeal to return to the high court to complete a part heard criminal case. Consequently, the section has been struck down and expunged from the Act. Even though the apex court has spoken with a note of authority and finality, the full implications of the judgment will continue to reverberate in and outside the country for quite some time. In the leading judgment of the court, Ejembi Eko JSC stated that “Ab initio, section 396 (7) of the ACJA 201T was set out to frontally contradict and challenge the letters, substance and spirit of section 290 (1) of the 1999 constitution.To that extent, section 396 (7) of the ACJA 2015 is inconsistent with the constitution, particularly section 290 (1) thereof .Therefore, by operation of section 1(3) of the constitution section 396 (7) of the ACJA 2015 to the extent of its inconsistency with section 290 (1) of the constitution, is void.” 
 
 With respect, many colleagues who have commended the Supreme Court for the “landmark judgment” have failed to advert their minds to similar provisions in other statutes which are regularly applied by the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Whereas section 396 (7) of the ACJA permits a Justice of the Court of Appeal to conclude a part heard criminal matter in the high court section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act empowers the Justices of the court to exercise the powers of a trial court as if the proceedings had been instituted in the Court of Appeal as a court of first instance. In the same vein, section 22 of the Supreme Court Act has vested the justices of the apex court with the powers of a trial court as if the proceedings had been instituted in the court as a court of first instance. Pursuant to section 22 of the Supreme Court Act, the justices of the apex court “… shall have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted and prosecuted in the Supreme Court as a court of first instance and may rehear the case in whole or in part or may remit it to the court below for the purpose of such rehearing or may give such other directions as to the manner in which the court below shall deal with the case in accordance with the powers of that court.” Similarly, the Court of Appeal has been empowered by Section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act to rehear a case and exercise all the powers of a judge of the high court in determining any appeal. Thus by virtue of section 22 of the Supreme Court Act and section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act, both appellate courts are permitted by the National Assembly to jettison the judgments of high courts and rehear the cases as if they were filed in both courts as courts of first instance. In the process, the justices of both appellate courts are allowed to grant interim or interlocutory orders of injunction and conduct trials like judges of the high court and deliver their judgments in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the court of first instance. Going by the authority of Ude Jones Udeogwu v FRN the powers conferred on both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to rehear cases like courts of first instance are illegal and void since sections 233 and 240 (1) of the constitution have limited the powers of both appellate courts to hear and determine appeals from lower courts. But if the law that empowers the justices of the Supreme Court to sit like a high court and rehear a case in its entirety is not unconstitutional why should it be unconstitutuonal for a justice of the Court of Appeal to return as a high court judge to conclude a part heard criminal matter? As the constitution has limited the powers of the appellate courts to hear and determine appeals arising from the decisions of lower courts are we to believe that the National Assembly violated the constitution when it conferred the powers of a high court judge on the Justices of the appellate courts? In other words, can section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act and section 22 of the Supreme Court Act be said to be constitutionally valid in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ude Jones Udeogu v FRN (supra)? Since the fiat given to Justice Mohammed Idris of the Court of Appeal to conclude the much delayed case of Orji Kalu & Ors v FRN was declared illegal and quashed by the Supreme Court, I have searched in vain for any constitutional provision that empowers the heads of the appellate courts to authorise serving justices of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court to preside over judicial commissions of inquiry instituted by state governors. For instance, the late Niki Tobi JSC was once given a fiat to preside over the judicial commission of enquiry set up by the Plateau state government. On two other occasions, the late jurist was given fiats by the Chief Justice to chair constitutional review committees in 1999 and 2005. The Honourable Justice Stephen Adah of the Court of Appeal recently served as the chairman of a commission of enquiry set up by Governor Simon Bako Lakong of Plateau State. Similarly, the Honourable Justice Mohammed Lawal Garba was appointed the Chairman of the judicial commission of enquiry set up by Governor Nasir el-Rufai, which probed the brutal massacre of the Shiites in Zaria in December 2014. From the information at my disposal the Honourable Justice Biobele Georgewill of the Nigerian Court of Appeal has just submitted the report of a commission of enquiry instituted by President Julius Maada Bio of Sierra Leone which investigated alleged corrupt practices of former public office holders in that country. Before then his lordship had also been authorised by the President of the court to chair the commission of enquiry which probed the allegations of human rights abuse by the armed forces of Nigeria. It is pertinent to note that the aforementioned justices of the Court of Appeal carried out the extra judicial duties assigned to them by state governors pursuant to the fiats received from the President of the Court of Appeal. It is on record that at the end of such enquiries the justices resumed duties in their courts. It is trite law that such judicial commissions of inquiry are inferior tribunals. Hence, the recommendations of the judicial tribunals which are accepted by the governments and published in white papers are usually challenged in the high courts. I have also not found any constitutional provision that empowers the Chief Justice of Nigeria or the National Judicial Council to post or second serving Justices of the High Court and Justices of the Court of Appeal and even the Supreme Court to sit in the courts of other countries. As serving Nigerian judges, the late Justice Udo Udoma and the late Justice Akinola Aguda served as Chief Justices of Uganda and Botswana respectively. At the end of their tenure they came back and returned to their courts. In those capacities both Chief Justices delivered epochal judgments which have stood the test of time. A few years ago, retired Justice Emmanuel Ayoola was a Justice of the Court of Appeal and Chief Justice of the Gambia. He returned to the Court of Appeal in Nigeria before his elevation to the Supreme Court. Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour served in the Supreme Court of The Gambia from 2008-2010 before his elevation to the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Justice Akomaye Agim was the Chief Justice of the Gambia and Swaziland. At the end of his meritorious service in both countries he was appointed a Justice of the Court of Appeal in Nigeria. Many other former and serving Justices of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Nigeria had been seconded as members of the apex court of The Gambia. In 2004, the Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed Justice Ayoola (retd) as President of Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone set up to try those responsible for the Sierra Leone Civil War. I was one of the lawyers who proffered arguments against the preliminary objections filed by former Liberian President, Mr. Charles Taylor against his trial.   Sometime in 2012, I was privileged to have appeared before the African Court on Human and People's Rights in Arusha, Tanzania when it sat for the first time in open court. I had appeared for myself in the case of Femi Falana  vs African Union (Application No. 001/11 ) A member of the Court at the material time is the Honourable Justice  Last year, I had cause to address the members of the bar and bench in that country. Three of the judges who attended the programme were High Court judges in Nigeria. The judges who are still serving in that country on secondment up till now are Babatunde Bakre J., Usman Masale J. and Patience Onagite-Kuejubola J. Another Nigerian Judge, the Honourable Justice Nkemdim Ameha Izuako has been sitting in the United Nations Disputes Tribunal since 2009. She is also the first female female judge in the High Court Judge of Solomon Island. All these eminent Nigerian judges were posted out of Nigeria by mere administrative fiats of the Chief Justice of Nigeria. Neither the constitution nor any law empowers the Chief Justice to give a fiat to any judge to serve outside Nigeria. I am wondering whether the decisions of such judges will not be impugned henceforth on the basis of the celebrated judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ude Jones Udeogu v FRN. Since the constitution has not clothed the Chief Justice of Nigeria with the powers to give fiats to judges to serve in the jurisdiction of other countries, has the judgment of the Supreme Court not effectively halted the secondment of Nigerian judges to serve as judges of superior courts in some commonwealth countries?"
Opinion,Ibrahim Agboola Gambari: A Presidential Babysitter Who Won’t Be As Powerful As Abba Kyari By Farooq Kperogi,"4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/ibrahim-agboola-gambari-presidential-babysitter-who-won%E2%80%99t-be-powerful-abba-kyari-farooq,"On paper, Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari’s choice as Buhari’s Chief of Staff is so far the regime’s most luminous appointment. Gambari is undoubtedly one of Nigeria’s most credentialed and globally visible citizens for whom the position of Chief of Staff to the President is actually a positional, even symbolic, downgrade. Ordinarily, the office of the Chief of Staff to the President is informal, discretionary, and of no consequence. Its inconsequence is underscored by the fact that the constitution does no recognize it and does not require the president to appoint anyone to perform its duties. That was why Umar Musa Yar’adua didn’t have one. The only reason the position of CoS to the President has become uncharacteristically visible in the last five years is that Buhari is both too cognitively incapacitated and too splendidly incompetent to function as president, so he needs a proxy or, as I pointed out in my April 22 status update, “a babysitter, a political and intellectual babysitter.” 
 
 As a military dictator, Tunde Idiagbon was Buhari’s political babysitter from 1983 to 1985. The late Salihijo Ahmad’s Afri-Projects Consortium (APC), was “the sole manager of the PTF projects,” according to Ray Ekpu’s June 5, 2018 article titled, “Petroleum Trust Fraud.” In other words, Buhari couldn’t even manage a government agency as small as the PTF without needing babysitting. Of course, most people know that since 2015 until his death, Abba Kyari was Buhari’s proxy. Mamman Daura, on whom Buhari is intellectually and emotionally dependent, “created” Abba Kyari for Buhari but Kyari later grew into a Frankenstein that almost devoured his “creator.” Daura wants no repeat of that and sees a potentially dutiful factotum in Gambari who was Buhari’s external affairs minister from 1984 to 1985. He seems like a person who would do a good job of concealing Buhari’s cognitive and mental infirmities from the public and from government officials, which is what the position of CoS to Buhari has now been reduced to. Although Gambari has intimidatingly impressive academic and professional credentials, he has no reputation for lofty, high-minded principles, which explains why he would even accept this position, which relegates rather than elevates him. He defended IBB’s ruinous invalidation of the June 12 presidential election, justified Abacha’s heartrending judicial murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni activists, and, according to the New York Times of Oct. 5, 1997, opposed something as innocuous as a planned renaming of a New York street after the late Kudirat Abiola who was murdered in cold blood by Abacha’s junta, which Gambari served. He also evinces what I call the overzealousness of the identitarian periphery, by which I mean people who are on the margins of a desired identity tend to go overboard to assert their membership of that identity in order to impress people who are rhetorically constituted as the core of that identity. Gambari is an Ilorin prince, but his middle name (and the name by which his close family members call him) is Agboola. “Ibrahim” is just for show. Although he traces patrilineal descent from the Fulani, he is culturally (and obviously genetically) Yoruba and doesn’t look anything like a Fulani man, yet Yoruba people won’t accept him as one of them. He’s on the geographic, symbolic, and cultural fringes of western and northern Nigerian identities, but he identifies as, and indeed is, a northerner. People who know him say he works excessively, if quietly, hard to prove his “northernness” through exaggerated subnationalist gamesmanship of the kind that someone from Kano or Sokoto with a similar educational and experiential exposure as he would find a little too extreme. People like that are often happy and willing tools of puppeteers who come from the identity they want to be seen as central to but to which they are marginal. My sense is that he won’t be nearly as powerful and as influential as Abba Kyari was for as long as Mamman Daura is alive. The only silver lining I see is that he probably won’t be as lazy as Abba Kyari was. Kyari was an indolent, self-absorbed presidential gatekeeper who allowed files that required urgent presidential attention to gather dust and who attended only to issues that feathered his nest. I hope Gambari would at least bring his considerable experience to help lubricate the rusty wheels of governance even while doing the bidding of his benefactor(s)."
Opinion,Why Have We Never Pushed For African-style Economic Imperialism? Incapable? By Charles Lambert,"4 Days Ago
",/2020/05/13/why-have-we-never-pushed-african-style-economic-imperialism-incapable-charles-lambert,"At no point in recent history have calls for Africa to industrialise been stronger than they have been lately. Across the continent, industrialisation is arguably the most talked-about subject among policymakers. So, why has action on the ground failed to move the needle on this important development marker? Why have we never pushed for African-style economic imperialism? Economic imperialism is a situation in which one country or continent has a lot of economic power or influence over others. This power, Africa has failed to possess. We are still dependent on European, Asian countries and others who possess economic imperialism. Industrialisation of Africa which will lead to economic imperialism has been a campaign promise across the African continent, with its acknowledged ability to bring prosperity, new jobs and better incomes for all. Yet the continent is less industrialised today than it was four decades ago. In fact, the contribution of Africa’s manufacturing sector to the continent’s gross domestic product actually declined from 12% in 1980 to 11% in 2013, where it has remained stagnant over the past few years, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa. 
 
 Had African leaders heeded advice from experts and pumped profits from the commodity boom into stimulating manufacturing companies, the results could have been different.  Experts have said that one of the main reasons for Africa’s slow industrialisation is that its leaders have failed to pursue bold economic policies out of fear of antagonising donors. African philosopher, Charles N Lambert, proposes that an African solution to lack of development in marginalised communities for the world is the principles of compassionate capitalism, empathy-driven innovations in business.  Lambert agrees that most businesses are driven by pure capitalism, and on the other hand-compassionate capitalism incorporate capitalism and at the same time provides empathy programs/innovations which is what Africa needs until they can stand on their own. In recent years, there has been much talk about capitalism evolving into a model of economy wherein corporations ensure that communitarian and people oriented business models are embraced so that profit is not the only criterion or reason why they are in business. In other words, Lambert is calling for capitalism to move beyond the “profit at all costs” paradigm and into a kinder and gentler variety that can place communities and people above the mindless pursuit of profit. Indeed, compassionate capitalism or capitalism with a human face is finding many takers both in the developed Western world and in the developing and emerging world in Asia and Latin America. Compassionate capitalism means that corporations have to account for the costs that they impose on the environment, the communities that lie in the vicinity of their factories and plants as well as offices, their employees whom they have to treat with more kindness, and the consumers and other stakeholders to whom they must be accountable. In other words, Lambert wants African corporations to practice a variety of capitalism that is more humane, compassionate, and just and fair. This not only entails a mindset change but also a movement away from the dominant philosophy of polluting the environment and refusing to pay for the cleanup, increasing pay for those at the top of the organisational hierarchy and letting those down the ladder high and dry, not compromising on quality and safety of their products and goods and services, and to be transparent in their dealings with regulators and the governmental agencies. It needs to be mentioned that in these times of planetary crisis where the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are threatening the very existence of civilisation, where gross income inequalities and the obscene wealth gap is leading to social unrest, and where the ever accelerating technological change threatens the social contract on which our relations with the world are based, compassionate capitalism is no longer an abstract and remote concept, but something that we need on an urgent basis. The true purpose of business is to uplift the experience of existing. It is not to make owners wealthy. It is not to produce ever-cheaper goods and services. Compassionate capitalism as Lambert has said, is an economic system meant to make a lot of money, help a lot of people, and have a lot of fun. It is not to keep an avaricious and toxic economic model afloat. And it is certainly not to make a profit.  To achieve this philosophy, Development Channel App should be adopted in Africa to help bridge the development divide between developed and underdeveloped countries through the use of 25 empathy driven companies covering creation of strong middle class, food security and strong infrastructure among the world's most disadvantaged. Nicknamed the Mother App because of the intricate presence of 24 other apps inside of it, the International Development App aims to fast-track development through highly informative videos on unprecedented innovations that bridge the development divide between underdeveloped countries and communities in comparison to the highly developed. It's a good one because it helps the less previlage financially. It is the first time in Africa's history to have a 25-in-1 app. And it's high time Africans woke up and embrace this move for Africa's style of economic imperialism.  Africa have been exploited by the West for way too long but with development channel, introduction of compassionate capitalism, there is going to be an economic revolution in Africa through the spirit of Pan-Africanism.  This, we can say is a calculated and orchestrated attempt to revamp Africa's economy, a move for Africa's economic liberation."

Arts,"Talent Vs Hard Work — Lessons From Olamilekan, The 11-Year-Old Who is Macron’s Newfound Friend By Mide Ayeni","1 Year Ago
",/2018/07/04/talent-vs-hard-work-%E2%80%94-lessons-olamilekan-11-year-old-who-macron%E2%80%99s-newfound-friend-mide,"I will tell you a story about talent and hard work. Which should come first? It's going to be a long read. First thing, I will also like to re-echo my constant words that “in 20 years’ time, ‘rock bottom’ will produce famous people more than ‘privilege.’” This afternoon, I had a chat with hubby about Olamilekan, that is the young 11-year-old who met with the President of France and drew his portrait in less than two hours. Well, let me explain. At the Afrika Shrine, where the French President went yesterday, the boy went to work and came out with a perfect portrait of Macron. The President was so thrilled that he said “This is exceptional”. Let's talk about Olamilekan. He's from a poor background. Rock bottom background! To most of us who see ourselves as average, Olamilekan sees us as privileged. He's so poor that he said: “In his family, they have to toil and sweat before they can put food on the table.” So he made a portrait showing a young boy with sweat all over him putting food on his table. Olamilekan was so emotional when he was speaking to BBC about that art work that I could sense the tears in his words. He called it his favourite. He is barely 11 years and he understands poverty and struggle so much that he could make a picture of it. Then you need to understand where he's coming from. Secondly, if you saw the house where Olamilekan was interviewed, you will understand his roots — his life and his story. I was drawn to him when I first saw the interview and downloaded the video to share with my son. You will also agree that I have posted his videos here more than twice. I was touched. Let me tell you a secret that many people don't know. You see, Olamilekan has a mother who is futuristic. She understands the dynamics of success. Although poor, she is not blind. Olamilekan said: “When I was six, I started drawing. My mother noticed it and took me to an artist to learn under him.” First, she understands the place of talent, nurturing, mentoring and hard work. She saw a son who loved to draw decided to NURTURE the TALENT by enrolling him with an artist, who will MENTOR and TRAIN him so that his TALENT can boom. This attribute that his mother showed is not learnt at Harvard. As a matter of truth, the most sophisticated and learned mothers/fathers don’t have it; they are shallow. They only understand the place of academics so they put their kids in an expensive school and pay for them to do another LESSON during breaks, especially the end-of-session break that is fast approaching and bug their heads with books without any opportunity to nurture the creative in them. Every single soul on earth has a TALENT and for most of them, without proper mentoring, they will miss it. Another thing is, she understands the role of TALENT before HARD WORK. Let me tell you another story. You remember Olajumoke and ‘Taju goes to School’, right? Well, Olajumoke became famous for photo-bombing a prominent British model’s photo-shoot and fame smiled on her. However, Olajumoke, though hardworking, has a no visible talent that we can pin her to. She is amazing and hardworking but what is her TALENT? What does she have to give to SUSTAIN the FAME? And you will notice that where Olamilekan was recognized, Olajumoke wasn’t. Olajumoke was popular on Nigerian social media and media stations but Olamilekan got a global recognition with top media stations. One of his videos has over 4.5 million views. I was elated. I was screaming and showing hubby the statistic. After the BBC Africa interview, BBC International showed him and Aljazeera, not wanting to duplicate BBC’s video, came to interview him too. You can imagine the role of talent. It’s like saying Olajumoke should come back and photo-bomb. It’s simply not achievable. But with talent, you can have a ‘come-back-to’ factor every time. The Bible says “a man’s gift makes way for him and makes him stand before Kings and not mere men”. And I always tell hubby that TALENT before HARD WORK. It’s when you understand the TALENT you have that you can now put in HARD WORK. Hard work has it reward and it sometimes comes late but TALENT is a show-stopper. TALENT catapults you into greatness. Talk about Ronaldo or Serana Williams and the many talents around us. I keep screaming it, parents need to do more. Olamilekan may not be the most brilliant boy in his class. He may not even be going to a private school for all you know, but he has a mother who knows what greatness smells like and I tell you, greatness is not in wealth or in books but in the mental growth of everyone. The day we all realize that we need to first know the talent that God has given us and how to nurture it, that is the day we have stopped EXISTING and have started LIVING. Olamilekan’s story can never remain the same again. He said: “I want to be like Michelangelo. and I was like ‘Tosin, how did he know this guy?’ Looking at his background, who told him the story of the great artist? Who are the ones your kids want to be like? Who are the people your kids live up to? Who are they? What story are you relating to them? You think if his mother was telling him about Slay Queen, he will know Michelangelo? What are you saying around your kids? And summer break is coming, some people are thinking of enrolling their kids in school again. Some are thinking otherwise. What are you thinking? What on earth are you thinking? I have said it million times, in 20 years, we are going to see the reward of our investments.  "
Opinion,Prof. Gambari Stuck In The Webs Of History By Seyi Oyetunbi,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/prof-gambari-stuck-webs-history-seyi-oyetunbi,"History they say, can never be re-written. You either reminisce with a bold smile or be reminded and shiver like a drenched stray hen. The reactions of notable Nigerians that trail the  appointment of the new Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, only shows that the international scholar is in a loggerhead with history. You can't pitch your tenth with the wicked and feign innocence.  The voyage of Prof. Gambari through the corridor of power started in his early 20s after his exposure to the best of education as a Political Scientist in one of the ivy league Universities in the United Kingdom. To put the record straight, he is the youngest diplomat Nigeria ever had. With his brilliance, exposure, forte, charisma and sagacity, one would expect Nigerians to be filled with joy over his appointment, but the reverse became the case. His predecessor, whose death came in as a shock, had a similar intimidating curriculum vitae, yet not as humongous as that of this Ilorin Emirati. It is not hyperbolic to opine that Prof. Ibrahim Gambari is on top of academic.  Yet, with all of his feats, the 79 Don is in a tussle with History. 
 
 There is apparently no historical perspective to Nigeria without these two symbolic events: annulment of the June 12 1993 election, and the unjust and arbitrary condemnation of the renowned environmental activist, Ken Saro Wiwa. The June 12th election could best be described as a political hullabaloo, as the election that flawlessly favoured the then African richest man was erroneously annulled to elongate the dark days of military dictatorship, in the country. Ibrahim Babangida gave the order. But like you would expect, some sycophants played active role in the way a president-elect metamorphosed to be a prisoner. Injustice of such genre should be penned in capital, isn't it! Our professor was part of those men of wonder. The Ogonni born, Ken Saro Wiwa was sentenced to death for asking the government for the needful. Ogonni is a locale directly linked to the major source of revenue for Nigeria, it is oil rich. Government was milking the oil at the expense of the inhabitants of the community.  The brave Revolutionist armed himself with his ideology and took it upon himself to call the government to order, he was no doubt a pain to the most corrupt and callous president, of course after Buhari, in the history of Nigeria. Abacha persecuted Saro Wiwa. He went away with it. Some powerful enjoyed that tragedy of governance. Our professor was part of those men of wonder. Nigeria should indeed be called a wonder-land, where the unimaginable happens, repeatedly. Buhari, after the demise of the London trained legal pundit, Abba Kyari was quoted to have said ""he is the best of them all."" I think baba knew what he meant. Abba Kyari was what he was, but Gambari is a nightmare to all patriotic citizens of this country who understand the danger of having the country in the hands of someone like Gambari. Those who are in a way or more familiar with history are all worried. I have come to agree with Buhari that Kyari was the best of them, as his successor can tutor the devil to be more devilish.  Ibrahim Gambari was the minister of foreign affairs to president Buhari, exactly 36years ago, when Nigeria population was just 81. 45million; he is today the Chief of State to the president when the population stands above 200million. You don't need excess grammar to understand that Buhari's administration places no relevance on the youth population. His gerontocratic frame of mind fused with gross nepotistic mental lens  is ""follow-come."" That man is too rigid for repentance.  Men like Ibrahim Gambari can only say ""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past,"" when we think he has achieved so much, in reality he has not really lived for anything.  Nigerians can do better by sending these old wagons out of our political space, through any feasible pattern, but we care less about things that matter. Let me borrow few words from Frantz Fanon from his major work, The Wretched of the Earth; “a government or a party gets the people it deserves and sooner or later a people gets the government it deserves.”"
Opinion,Presidency And Many Lies Of COVID-19 Figures In Nigeria By Jumu’ah Abiodun,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/presidency-and-many-lies-covid-19-figures-nigeria-jumu%E2%80%99ah-abiodun,"I can't write anything about the most popular phrase on earth, “novel Coronavirus pandemic” without sending my special greetings to those medical teams and caregivers home and abroad as well as journalists who have also been on the frontline of reporting day and night activities of how the deadly virus has affected many homes, sports, religious and the global economy among others.  Many Nigerians since the first confirmed case of an Italian man, who came into the country from Italy via Istanbul, Turkey, on Thursday, 27 February 2020, believe COVID-19 in Nigeria is fake due to the saying that the virus can’t survive in warmer weather and immune system of black people to malaria and typhoid. But the deadly COVID-19 is obviously not ‘fake news’. Due to corrupt nature of many Nigerian politicians and the poverty rate in the country, the citizens believe the virus has become a money-making venture for Nigerian Government because of the relief fund from governments of the United States, European Union and the United Kingdom as well as support from International Monetary Fund and World Health Organisation. 
 
 Before the European Union donated N21bn to Nigerian Government as part of its contribution to boosting the country’s COVID-19 response, the highest daily figure the country recorded was 20 cases that was confirmed by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control as at 9:50pm on Monday, 13th April 2020. ‘The Day’ Nigerian Government cash out contribution fund from EU, 19 new cases were reported as at 9:20pm Tuesday,14th April, 2020 with 14 in Lagos, 2 in Federal Capital Territory, 1 Kano, Akwa Ibom and Edo states respectively, raised the total number of confirmed cases to 362 while 99 were discharged and 11 deaths. Same day at around 11:00pm, NCDC reported an additional 11 new cases in Lagos, totalling 373 confirmed cases, 99 discharged and 11 deaths. Who is deceiving who? A day after Nigeria received the donation, the country’s reported cases shot up to 34, Lagos recorded 18, Kano with 12, 2 in President Muhammadu Buhari’s state, Katsina and 1 in Delta and Niger states respectively, that was confirmed at exactly 11:20pm on Wednesday, 15th April. As at 11:20 pm on Thursday, 16th April, NCDC confirmed another 35 new cases with 19 in Lagos, 9 in FCT, 5 in Kano and 2 in Oyo states which brought the total confirmed cases to 442, 152 persons discharged and 13 deaths recorded. Aside from EU contribution, notable Nigerians and many corporate organisations donated billions of naira to support the Federal Government of Nigeria and state governments in the fight to combat the deadly virus. The funds include $13m (N5bn) donation by the United Bank for Africa. Herbert Wigwe, Segun Agbaje, Abdulsamad Rabiu, Keystone Bank, Femi Otedola, Jim Ovia and Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote all donated N1bn each to support the government in curtailing the pandemic in the country https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/03/27/africa/coronavirus-nigeria-fund/index.html Away from the above figures or statistics, many Nigerians accused FG of siphoning the donations and not focusing it to the right channels.   Meanwhile, during the five weeks of lockdown in FCT, Lagos and Ogun states, millions of Nigerians most especially those in South-West region of the country faulted President Buhari's type of palliatives as being biased and not sincere with the distribution of the fund. A lot of Nigerians took to social media platforms to express their bitterness and asked Mr President to approach the Central Bank of Nigeria to distribute palliative for them through their respective Bank Verification Number. Instead of doing this, Nigeria's Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, contracted it to two payment service providers and distributed the Conditional Cash Transfer to poor Nigerians in some parts of the country.   Sadiya Farouq, in a statement on Tuesday, 14th April, 2020 named Zamfara, Akwa Ibom, Abia and Bayelsa among states where the delay in payment due to the inefficiency of the contractors. She said, “The Federal Government cannot accept delays in the current payment round of N20,000 stipends to beneficiaries in poor and vulnerable households under any excuse in the four states or any other state of the federation. “The failure of any payment service providers to meet their contractual agreement is unacceptable. “The Federal Government through the ministry cannot allow contractors to derail the immediate CCT to the poor and the vulnerable.”   Nigerians lambasted the Presidency for televised recorded 'Presidential broadcast', saying the only way President Buhari can know their agony is through media chat where journalists can ask questions.   These clearly show how few opportunists who found themselves in power ripped off the masses. These few people not limited to the arrogant President's spokesman, Femi Adesina, who on a live radio said somebody is talking like a ""Broken Record"". This is the height of irresponsible government who don't want to be held accountable for their incompetence. My questions to the Presidency on contracting CCT to payment providers are: Can't CBN generate number of BVN and disburse the same amount approved at all level, either billionaire, millionaire, “thousandnaire or hundrednaire”? What's President Buhari-led administration definition of poor or vulnerable Nigerians in a country where over 82.9 million citizens live in poverty? NBS report shows http://worldtopnewsng.com/nbs-report-shows-82-9-million-nigerians-live-in-poverty/ Mid-April, NCDC and Kano State Government disagreed on the number of confirmed cases and announced conflicting figures to the world. Kano published 21 cases on its twitter handle while NCDC recorded 16 for the state in its chart. https://twitter.com/NCDCgov/status/1250550394847203328?s=19 http://worldtopnewsng.com/ncdc-state-govt-post-conflicting-covid-19-cases-reports/ The NCDC on Sunday, 10th May, 2020 afterwards published that Nigeria recorded 15 deaths, 238 new cases of COVID-19 and 33 persons were discharged apologized to Nigerians that it posted an additional 32 discharged cases and 2 deaths to the figures of the FCT. https://twitter.com/NCDCgov/status/1259618115543072778?s=19 According to the agency, Nigeria now has 4, 641 confirmed cases with 150 deaths and 902 discharged. Recently, one of Nigeria's top television station, TV Continental in a special report exposed how the Nigerian Government handle the most popular virus in the world, COVID-19. A TVC correspondent was in Prof Idris Mohammed Infectious Hospital, Kwadon, Gombe State, where he spoke with some of the patients, exposed the living condition in the hospital where patients protested about their welfare and feeding.   The patients also alleged that since some of them have been confined for up to two weeks they have not been given any medication by the team, neither taken care of by the government. They also complained of not seeing any doctor for days. A male patient who spoke with TV Continental said since he has been at the isolation centre he was not given anything. Another patient, a female who explained her grievances said nothing like drug was given to any of them, expressing that even if any of them feels headache they gave the hospital their money to buy drugs. She expressed further that they don’t have any drug neither doctor, just them and the gateman. They also complained about eating unhealthy food. The COVID-19 patients went out that fateful day to block the highway that links Gombe to Borno and Adamawa states where they mingled with members of the communities protesting alongside with them. Some of them said COVID-19 pandemic figures in Nigeria was fake and is just being used to make money. The Gombe State COVID-19 Pandemic Response Team spokesperson, Dr. Mohammed Kwami, in a message conveyed to me via the Senior Special Assistant to the governor on Media and Publicity, Mr Ismaila Uba Misili, confirmed the protest by the patients and said the government noted with dismay and disappointment then apologised for such an incident. The COVID-19 Task Force explained that the truth is; one of the female patients was admitted to the centre with a wound she got long before she came into the state. The task force took it upon itself to treat the wound, similar to what was applied for all the isolated patients; all those with underlying diseases are being managed irrespective of its relation to the COVID-19 infection. Kwami explained further that the social implication is clearly visible. That majority of the cases in the state were menial workers who returned from Lagos, Abuja or Kano, after realising they could not bear the consequences of the on-going lockdowns in those cities, as their earnings depend on a daily outing. If truly all these protesters as reported by the NCDC or the state government were confirmed patients of COVID-19 imagine the number of people they would have mingled with during the protest, hundreds of people might have been infected by now and not showing symptoms yet. 'There's fire on the mountain' President Buhari should declare total lockdown in Gombe, Borno and Adamawa states and provide a genuine and serious palliative for Nigerians. And also continue an in-depth investigation into the causes of the death toll in Kano State.   "
Opinion,"In Africa, Trump’s Fate Is Worse Than A Laughing Stock By Azu Ishiekwene","3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/africa-trump%E2%80%99s-fate-worse-laughing-stock-azu-ishiekwene,"In a recent article in The Atlantic also widely used elsewhere, American journalist, Anne Applebaum, described the pathetic meltdown of US President Donald Trump, especially since the outbreak of the global health crisis, COVID-19. According to the journalist, not only has Trump become the butt of jokes in video games, the US President’s serial faux pas in managing the health crisis has also made him a laughing stock in memes and cartoons. On April 29, the US President reportedly phoned his Nigerian counterpart, Muhammadu Buhari, and promised to help with some ventilators. The next day, an irreverent mascot in a cartoon strip in LEADERSHIP, a Nigerian newspaper, asked if Trump was also going to send “Dettol vaccines,” a sarcastic reference to the President’s claim that disinfectants could mitigate the effect of Coronavirus.
 
 Now, something worse than being a laughing stock is happening to Trump and he could be merrily unaware. That idiom - laughing stock - was reserved for President George W. Bush, who was looked upon disdainfully in some intellectual circles because of his demeanour and his penchant for off-colour jokes. Yet, for good or ill, Bush still managed to keep the world riveted on America. It was difficult to ignore him. Trump is making the Bush White House look like the golden era of US exceptionalism. Africa is not laughing at Trump. The continent is ignoring him. It seems so long ago when his book, The art of the deal or How to get rich, was the companion of young wannabe millionaires. Or when his reality TV show was a favourite of millennials on the continent and those in diaspora. It seems so long ago when his entrepreneurial skill and maverick essence were hailed by non-conformists as the only way to checkmate the status quo. It seems so long ago when Trump’s underdog status and his story as the ultimate political outsider were regarded as the new model for recruiting transformational leadership and hailed as the cookbook to overthrow gerontocrats, sit-tight leaders and vested interests on the continent. Yet today, even Trump’s promise to make America great again sounds so alien and so hollow, that all the catastrophes in between - from his shredding of the Paris Climate Agreement to his scuppering of the Iran nuclear deal to his trade wars with China - are like echoes from a distant past. But they are not. These imprints from the Trump years created shock and consternation at first, then quickly gave way to sneering and laughter. Now, it seems some countries are no longer laughing, as Applebaum suggested in her article. They’re doing something worse: ignoring Trump and his America. How do you deal with the President of the most powerful country in the world who decides that it is in the world’s greatest moment of the need for co-operation and solidarity that he must walk alone? How do you respond to a president who despite multiple early warnings by his own experts that his country - and perhaps the rest of the world - could be faced with a pandemic decides to live in denial, only to be looking for scapegoats later? How exactly do you handle a president who does not know the difference between bug and germ and microbe and yet would not listen to those who know? A president who, in spite of being surrounded by people who know, insists, with a straight face, that UV light, a bit of sunshine or perhaps ingestion of disinfectant, will make everything all right again? From some of the world’s shitholes - so described and despised by Trump - answers are coming that ought to make the US President feel ashamed, if he hasn’t passed that point already. South Africa is not looking to the US for help to combat COVID-19, as it once did at the height of its struggle against the spread of HIV/AIDS. Bush was US President then. He will be remembered for making the most consequential intervention through the provision of antiretroviral drugs at a cost of about $80billion, which saved about 13million lives, mostly in Africa. Today, Washington and Pretoria have grown apart, with President Cyril Ramaphosa rebuffing Trump’s request to slam the door on Huawei over 5G. And in the fight against Coronavirus, instead of going to the US, South Africa has engaged Cuban doctors, as have Togo, Cape Verde and Angola. Ghana has been quite exemplary in its testing, tracing and treatment, and even deployed drones in delivering test results from rural areas to some hospitals at a time when deaths in the US were mounting, tests lagging and yet Trump was locked in a bitter quarrel with China over what to call the virus. Senegal, traditionally France-leaning, has set its own modest example accrued from its experience in managing dengue fever and Ebola six years ago. It has developed a $1 test kit, which gets the job done in 10 minutes and has joined the global race in the search for a vaccine. And though COVID-organics from Madagascar may sound like the herbal version of Trump’s disinfectant, it’s a measure of the desperate times that Nigeria, Tanzania, Guinea-Bissau and even Liberia, have ordered supplies. Nigeria’s President could not even wait for Trump’s ventilators before lining up! It’s a tragic irony that Liberia joined the train to Antananarivo for a suspicious herbal remedy, even though its historical ties with the US should have made Washington its first port of call. Those days are gone. Those who are not looking to Cuba or Madagascar are going East, inviting Chinese help in spite of the recent upsurge in racism against Africans in that country. Sure, China is not exactly a sterling example in managing Coronavirus. It has more to account for than it is willing to admit. But Trump’s incompetence has managed to make President Xi Jinping look like a messiah. That is what the Chinese Coronavirus response team around the world has been called: messiah. The void created by US absence, compounded by Trump’s personal hubris, has left others with no choice but to take their fate in their own hands - the very opposite of the lesson history teaches about how the world overcame some of its greatest trials in the past.  Some may argue that the response from many parts of the world, especially the unsparing criticisms of what appears to be Trump’s congenital flaws, have been unfairly exploited by his opponents in an election year. Conspiracy theories on both sides have had a field day and Trump may have been hard done by a section of the liberal press. In the end, however, he only is responsible for his own fate. If instead of using his own experts he chooses to rely on anecdotes and instead of following the facts he decides to invent his own reality, how can even his allies defend or save him, much less his enemies? Even in Nigeria where Trump had a sizable following among evangelicals who believed Barack Obama was the anti-Christ (mainly because of his stance on gay rights), the US President’s mismanagement of COVID-19 has left his reputation in shreds. And Nigeria’s President whose encounter with him in Washington Trump once described in morbid terms, must be wondering who really needs a life now. This could be the moment when the continent rediscovers itself and redeems its shambolic healthcare system. The voices calling for China to pay reparation for its malicious negligence are as resonant and determined as those asking the continent to look beyond the US to protect and save itself and its citizens. That is good. Fewer and fewer people are concerned about what the US does with itself in November – whether it would be Blue or Red, Joe Biden or Donald Trump again. Trump is not a laughing matter anymore. We’re past caring."
Opinion,Orji Uzor Kalu’s Case - Was The Supreme Court Correct? By Professor ’Gbenga Bamodu,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/orji-uzor-kalu%E2%80%99s-case-was-supreme-court-correct-professor-%E2%80%99gbenga-bamodu,"In its recent judgment in   (unreported Appeal No SC. 662C/2019; delivered May 9, 2020), the Nigerian Supreme Court declared section 396(7) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (‘ACJA’) to be inconsistent with provisions of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999. Specifically, the Supreme Court held that section 396(7) of the ACJA is inconsistent with section 290 of the 1999 Constitution and that it is thus void to the extent of that inconsistency. The background factual context is that during the criminal trial of former governor Orji Uzo Kalu and another person in the Federal High Court on corruption charges, the presiding judge was promoted to the Court of Appeal. Nevertheless, pursuant to a ‘fiat’ issued by the President of the Court of Appeal, purportedly in light of section 396(7) of the ACJA, the judge concluded the trial which resulted in the conviction of the appellant and the former governor. The Supreme Court held that the purported grant of dispensation under section 396(7) of the ACJA, to a judge who had been promoted to the Court of Appeal, to conclude an extant trial in the Federal High Court was inconsistent with section 290(1) of the 1999 Constitution in light, inter alia, of section 253 of the Constitution. In light of its conclusion on the constitutionality of section 396(7) ACJA the Supreme Court quashed the conviction of the Appellant and ordered a fresh trial; it is not clear that the conviction of the co-accused governor was actually quashed. 
 
 It is the contention in this essay that, at the very least, section 396(7) of the ACJA is capable of legitimate and juridically sound interpretation in a manner consistent with both sections 253 and 290 of the 1999 Constitution. At the worst, the Supreme Court’s approach to the interpretation of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions is, arguably, erroneous – a suggestion that is never made lightly. It is necessary to set out the provisions of section 396(7) of the ACJA in full: Notwithstanding the provision of any other law to the contrary, a Judge of the High Court who has been elevated to the Court of Appeal shall have dispensation to continue to sit as a High Court Judge only for the purpose of concluding any part-heard criminal matter pending before him at the time of his elevation and shall conclude the same within a reasonable time: Provided that this subsection shall not prevent him from assuming duty as a Justice of the Court of Appeal. Section 396(7) ACJA, by its own terms, gives ‘dispensation’ to the promoted judge ‘to continue to sit as a High Court judge’ albeit only for a particular purpose which is to conclude a pending part-heard criminal matter. This provision applies to the Federal High Court as much as to other High Courts in Nigeria. It is important to stress some elements of section 396 ACJA in light of the central argument of this essay.  i. ‘Dispensation’ is Given by the Act Itself – No Need for a ‘Fiat’ Section 396(7) says that the elevated judge ‘shall have dispensation ….’ In line with standard principles of interpretation, that provision does not by itself require any further formality to confer the dispensation on the elevated judge. Many provisions of even the Nigerian Constitution establishing various bodies provide ‘there shall be [insert body]’. A pertinent example is section 249(1) of the 1999 Constitution which provides: ‘There shall be a Federal High Court’.  It is contended that by the terms of section 396(7) of the ACJA itself, the ‘fiat’ purportedly given by the President of the Court of Appeal to the elevated judge in the instant case, although an admirable administrative exercise, was not a legal necessity or requirement. The Supreme Court implicitly itself accepted the distinction between the ‘statutory dispensation’ and the ‘administrative Fiat/permission’ just as the court did well to overlook, essentially, the predication of the fiat/permission on the ‘Criminal Justice Act 2015’. ii. The Elevated Judge Remained a Judge of the High Court – But Only for A Special Purpose The Supreme Court’s decision hangs heavily on a conclusion that the elevated judge had ceased to be a judge of the Federal High Court. For this, the Supreme Court relied on cases decided before the enactment of the ACJA; in particular,   The Court dismissed the argument of the Respondent’s counsel that the law had changed since those cases. It is suggested, as explained further shortly, that the Court was perhaps hasty in dismissing the counsel’s argument, particularly simply on the basis that a cross appeal was not filed in light of the acceptance of those earlier judgments by the lower court.  Once again, in fairness to the Supreme Court, it did pursue an investigation into the point whether the law had changed since the enactment of the ACJA but was persuaded by the argument that the purported change would amount to a non-permissible constitutional amendment. This is a point where serious issues arise for challenging the interpretive approach adopted by the Supreme Court. After acknowledging the establishment of the Federal High Court under section 249 of the 1999 Constitution, the Supreme Court pointed out that under section 250 of the Constitution a judge of the Federal High Court is appointed on recommendation of the President to the National Judicial Council. On the other hand, there was no issue that the elevated judge in the instant case had been duly appointed to the Federal High Court. The real issue therefore turned on whether upon elevation to the Court of Appeal, the judge had ceased to be a judge of the High Court. Critically, the real issue should have turned on whether the elevated judge had ceased to be a judge of the High Court for all purposes and time which, it is contended, could have led the court to a deeper consideration of the provisions of section 396(7) of the ACJA and, possibly, to a different conclusion. The Supreme Court simply proceeded on the basis that since it had held previously in Ogbunyiya v Okudo and Our Line v SCC, that a High Court judge elevated to the Court of Appeal ceased to be a judge of the High Court, section 396(7) ACJA could not be read together with constitutional provisions to extend the tenure of the judge as a High Court judge. The problem is that this is not what section 396(7) does, when read properly together with the relevant constitutional provisions. Rather, what section 396(7) does when read properly with relevant constitutional provisions is to give a special dispensation (interpreted by the court as doing something not otherwise permitted) for a specific trial. A very strong anchor of the Supreme Court’s reasoning is its approach to the interpretation of section 253 of the Constitution and it is acknowledged that the provision poses the biggest challenge to the contention of this paper. Section 253 of the 1999 Constitution provides that: “the Federal High Court shall be duly constituted if it consists of at least one Judge of that Court.’ This anchor of the reasoning is buttressed by section 249(2) of the Constitution which provides that the Federal High Court shall consist of the Chief Judge and such number of judges as may be statutorily prescribed. Critically, however, these provisions would only debar an elevated judge if they truly mean that he has ceased to be a judge of the Federal High Court – for all purposes. These constitutional provisions themselves do not by their own terms lend support to a conclusion that an elevated Federal High Court judge cannot sit as a judge of the Federal High Court for a special purpose and with legally provided dispensation. This was indeed the approach taken by the Court of Appeal but which the Supreme Court rejected. In light of the particular terms of the provisions of section 253 of the 1999 constitution, perhaps the truly key question which needed to be examined more carefully is whether a judge of the Federal High Court who has been elevated to the Court of Appeal can yet be regarded as a judge of the Federal High Court in any circumstances at any time at all. It is submitted that section 253 permits of such an interpretation. At the time of elevation, the judge was evidently qualified and was indeed a judge of the lower court; he does not cease to be qualified by being elevated. This prompts a necessity for the inverse question whether he is disqualified; well, there is no constitutional provision which clearly or expressly disqualifies him – let alone disqualifies him for all purposes. The Supreme Court relied only on its own previous decisions for holding him disqualified. And here, lies the reason why the Supreme Court needed to have paid greater attention to the argument that the law had changed. It is contended that the Supreme Court should have exercised greater caution and showed greater sensitivity that the lawmaker in enacting section 396(7) of the ACJA must have been aware of the court’s previous decision. It is not unknown in Nigerian jurisprudence that the legislature sometimes makes an enactment with the intention of modifying or moderating judicial jurisprudence as the history of the seminal Lakanmi case teaches us; sometimes it is even legitimate and justifiable. The issue of inordinate delay in Nigerian courts due to various factors including, topically, elevation of judges is well known. It is quite obvious that the enactment of section 396(7) ACJA is an attempt to deal with at least one source of such delays. A very welcome effort that actually brings Nigerian jurisprudence on the point in line with jurisprudence and practice in other respected common law jurisdictions. In fact in England: ‘The judges of the Court of Appeal are the Heads of Division (the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Master of the Rolls, the President of the Queen’s Bench Division, the President of the Family Division and the Chancellor of the High Court) and the Lords Justices of Appeal ….’ https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/judicial-roles/judges/coa-judges/ The fact that the Nigerian constitutional provisions do not by their terms, at least not expressly, debar an elevated judge from sitting in his prior court upon elevation coupled with a statutory provision that expressly allows him to do so for a special purpose by dispensation demanded greater scrutiny. The admirable purpose of section 396(7) ACJA and the reality of inordinate delay in the Nigerian judicial system also demanded greater scrutiny and an absolute conviction and clearer demonstration of inconsistency. In essence, barring a hard-line interpretation of section 253 of the 1999 Constitution, the Supreme Court’s decision simply boils down to saying previous judicial authority had held that an elevated judge ceases to be a judge of his prior court. If section 253 is read in accordance with its own terms and construed as simply meaning that a judge of the Federal High Court is a judge duly appointed to that court, which may be permanently or specially, the supposed inconsistency of section 396(7) disappears. And the Supreme Court would not even need to overrule itself.  iii. The Relevance of Section 290 of the 1999 Constitution Ultimately, the specific constitutional provision that the Supreme Court held section 396(7) ACJA to be inconsistent with is section 290 of the 1999 Constitution. The element of the provision relied on by the Supreme Court is the provision that a person appointed to any judicial office shall not perform the functions of the office until he has taken the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath; the section also now includes requirements relating to declaration of assets. The court held that it had interpreted the previous equivalent of this provision (s. 254 of the 1979 Constitution) to mean that a person elevated to a higher court ceases to be a judge of the court from which he was elevated.  On the other hand, according to its own terms and discernible intendment, section 290 of the Constitution would have been more relevant in the context of whether the elevated judge could start performing his functions as a judge of the Court of Appeal. It could also be relevant in the context of a question whether the judge had previously met the preconditions for the exercise of his functions as a judge of the Federal High Court. Neither of this was in issue in this case and the stridently hostile attitude displayed in the latter part of the judgment towards section 396(7) of the ACJA as being intended to usurp section 290 of the Constitution is, it is respectfully submitted, unwarranted. It is both telling and mildly perplexing at the same time that section 290 is the specific provision that section 396(7) ACJA was held to be inconsistent with; simply, a provision that the Supreme Court had interpreted in a particular way – before a statutory, or at least a purported statutory, change to the law. A stronger case could have been made that section 396(7) ACJA is inconsistent with section 253 of the Constitution but the argument in this paper has shown that the two provisions are not necessarily inconsistent. In fact, it is suggested that section 396(7) ACJA can not only be interpreted in a manner consistent with but indeed also complementary to section 253 of the Constitution while, strictly, it is unaffected by the separate issue of preconditions for the performance of the role of the position to which a judge has been appointed. It is difficult to escape a conclusion that a nebulous application of precedent seems to have got in the way of greater and more careful constitutional and statutory analyses."
Opinion,Ibrahim Gambari: The Trails Of Treachery By Remi Oyeyemi,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/ibrahim-gambari-trails-treachery-remi-oyeyemi,"""Treacherous people do not last, only memories of their treason last.""     - Amit Abraham, the founding Deputy Vice Chancellor at the Mount Zion International University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda. In 1984, when Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi was first nominated as the Minister of External Affairs by General Ibrahim Babangida who was then the Chief of Army Staff under the regime of Muhammadu Buhari, General Tunde Idiagbon, who was Second-In-Command as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters, and was from Kwara State had also nominated Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, a fellow Kwaran, for the same position. Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi would be coming off as the Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) in 1983. For whatever reasons, Prof. Gambari did not like the competition and the competitor. He went to works. He manufactured fatuous tall tales to malign the person and character of Prof. Akinyemi. He lied against him unabashedly. His fictitious stories were so powerful that Prof. Akinyemi was subjected to very serious interrogations and he was almost clamped into the gulag.  Prof. Gambari was successful in his campaign of calumny against Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi. He, Gambari, was eventually appointed by Mohammadu Buhari as Minister of External Affairs in 1984. He was in that office until 1985 when Buhari was overthrown by General Ibrahim Babangida for his tyranny as Head of State. Babangida finally replaced Prof. Gambari with Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi in that position. Prof. Akinyemi was there from 1985 to 1987 when he was succeeded by General Ike Nwachukwu. 
 
 That was not Prof. Gambari's first venomous act as a snake. And it was not his last. As I write this, three incumbent Ministers in the cabinet of Mohammed Buhari are trying to contain their disgust about his appointment. Two of them are Northerners and one of them, Southwesterner. They are all previous victims of perfidious venoms of Ibrahim Gambari, the man who goes about using a middle name, ""Agboola"", to suck in unsuspecting victims of Yorùbá stock as their fellow traveler before devouring them. Prof. Ishaya Audu was the Minister of External Affairs under President Shehu Shagari, 1979 - 1983. How much he knew Prof. Gambari in 1981 was the basis on which he had warned Ambassador Oladapo Fafowora to beware of his new protégé ""Agboolá"" Gambari. Amb. Fafowora at that time, was holding fort as Deputy Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations, in New York. For those who have read Amb. Fafowora's comments on Prof. Gambari which had gone viral, what Amb. Fafowora did not disclose in those comments are legion. They are too personal and private and should be left out for the sake of Prof. Gambari's wife. The point is that Prof. Gambari has compiled a resume of treachery against several of his benefactors, friends, colleagues and mere acquaintances who might have come within his range. Amb. Fafowora who himself has an intimidating resume, had been impressed with the accomplishments of a young lecturer who needed help. As a distinguished man of excellence himself and a product of Oxford as well as University of London, Amb. Fafowora was attracted to the brilliance of Prof. Gambari. I expected that to be natural for and to all brilliant minds unconsumed and uncontaminated with morbid ambition and subversive selfishness and egoism.  But unfortunately, for Amb. Fafowora and many of his ilk whose paths have crossed that of Prof. Gambari,  his kind-hearted act towards the new Chief of Staff to President Buhari was what led to his early retirement from the service where he had for several decades, put in excellent and unblemished service. It is this kind of snakish and rankish acts of ingratitude propelled by unmitigatable ego and ambition that have robbed many innocent others of help that they might have received. I met Prof. Gambari in New York in 1996. He was the Nigerian Ambassador to the United Nations. We met for the first time in the evening of the day I had gone to testify at the Kansas' Senator Nancy Kassenbaum's inspired Senate Hearings on General Sani Abacha regime asking for sanctions. During our meeting, it was obvious what his mission was. But we could not click for obvious reasons. He was defending the Abacha Regime and I was against Abacha Regime on the account of which I had escaped Nigeria, a week after the murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa. Since, I had watched Prof. Gambari from distance. He, like Abba Kyari, is a very brilliant mind. But his brilliance have been more often deployed to dastardly acts. What is the use of a brilliance deployed to inflict misery on others? What is the value of the brilliance deployed to the destruction of others? What is the use of a brilliance only handy for the subversion of others? What is the race of life about that it would inform one's brilliance not to help others, but to destroy them? His public statements, to me, are the definitions of his character and philosophy. His education have not rubbed off on him. Prof. Gambari and his immediate predecessor as the Chief of Staff to President Buhari have shown that going to great and famous schools are not determinants of great character. Living a life of subterfuge and subversion of others evidently are flagships of their characters. Prof. Gambari is dirty and dingy. It is unfortunate that his kind of character is the type who get to lead in this contraption called Nigeria. He defended Abacha Regime very truculently. He made it clear in his utterances and statements that he was anti - people. He, without remorse and for his own selfish ends, edified tyranny and the destruction of democracy. This obviously was easier for him as a Fulani hegemonist. As a scion of a feudalist institution already percolating as rulers over another man's land that doesn't belong to them in whatever fashion, his acts of treacheries are not out of character.  To someone like Prof. Gambari, fairness has no meaning. Justice is an anathema. Balance is a pariah. Equity is an enemy. Gratitude is an abomination, because they feel entitled even to things that are not theirs. For Prof. Gambari whose forefathers betrayed Afonja and took over Ìlorin by murdering him and members of his household, being grateful is a taboo. They are emotional, economic, political and intellectual predators.  Prof. Gambari, like Salih Janta, also known as Shehu Alimi, his ancestor who murdered the Yorùbá owners of Ìlorin, uses subtlety, intricate relationship to gain your trust and put in the dagger when you're not expecting. The Gambaris of this world are the reasons for the aphorismic sobriquet ""Ìlorin mèsú jàmbá."" Literally, it means ""Ìlorin, the treacherous."" Though, this is often trivialised as jokes and used as banters nowadays, it is not a compliment by any means. The beauty of History is that it is a wonderful guide for future events. Every treachery in History always had expiry dates. The Ìlorin treachery would expire at the appropriate time. It would not be the first and it won't be the last. No matter how long it lasts, it would expire. No amount of instruments of power of the Nigeria State would suffice. In fact, Nigeria itself is on the fast pace down the drain and it might not even subsist by the time History comes. As the new Chief of Staff to the President, millions like me have no expectations from Ibrahim Gambari. He is a perfect choice for a regime of hegemonic zealots. Himself, a Yoru - phobic fanatic, a scion of feudalism and heir of serfdom, he had once said that Nigerians needed not democracy but food. It could be inferred that the pseudo democracy in operation under this Buhari's Presidency would suffer more. And hopefully, now that he is back in government, we wait to see how he makes food available to Nigerians. For those who would be dealing with him in this dispensation, it is important that they stay alert and tread very carefully. With smiles that do not go beyond the lips, any of them could be sucked into their political demise. It was Emily Thorne, a fictional character and the main protagonist of the ABC television series ""Revenge"" that once insisted, ""For the innocent, the past may hold a reward, but for the treacherous it's only a matter of time before the past delivers what they truly deserve."" Over and over, time has proved her right."
Opinion,Disobedience Of Court Orders By Comptroller-General Is Unhealthy For Democracy By Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN),"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/disobedience-court-orders-comptroller-general-unhealthy-democracy-ebun-olu-adegboruwa-san,"Very recently, the Comptroller-General of the Correctional Centres gave an order to his officers not to admit new defendants into correctional centres, presumably as part of COVID-19 precautions. This executive order is now being complied with, and it has very grave implications for the rule of law and the administration of justice in Nigeria. The reports across the country is that defendants, who are arraigned in court for very serious capital offences are being denied admission into custody at the correctional centres, in compliance with the executive order of the CGCC, in violation of the order of various courts for their remand, pending trial. The order of court for the remand of a defendant awaiting trial is made in the exercise of the judicial powers conferred upon the court by the constitution, especially section 6 (6)(b) thereof. It therefore amounts to contempt of court for any person, however highly placed, to refuse to obey the order of a court of law. 
 
 Under and by virtue of section 287 of the constitution, all persons in Nigeria, exercising legislative, judicial and executive powers, are obliged to ensure compliance with the order of all courts. To that extent, it is illegal and unconstitutional for the CGCC to direct officers under him to wilfully disobey lawful orders made by any court. The danger that this illegal order of the CGCC poses to the due administration of justice are many; likelihood of escape by defendants, who have capital offences to deal with, tampering with witnesses and also compromising evidence. Where does the CCGC expect the courts to keep persons who are newly sentenced and convicted, for instance? The CGCC cannot rely on the Correctional Services Act to exercise powers in conflict with the authority of a court of law duly established under the constitution. It is an aberration that should not be allowed to fester. I therefore call upon the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, to direct the CGCC to ensure compliance with all orders of court in respect of defendants awaiting trial and those already convicted by the court. COVID-19 should not be an excuse to disobey court orders."
Opinion,Who Is Ibrahim “Agboola” Gambari? By Dr Bolaji O. Akinyemi,"2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/who-ibrahim-%E2%80%9Cagboola%E2%80%9D-gambari-dr-bolaji-o-akinyemi,"Nigerians were obviously traumatised by the discharge of duties by the office of the Chief of Staff since Buhari's Presidency. ""Kyariphobia"" seemed to grip the nation in expectations of who the next Chief of Staff to the President will be. The fear was justified but misplaced.  The life and time of Abba Kyari was beautiful until he became Buhari's Chief of Staff. I have met persons who worked closely with the late Chief of Staff in his days at UBA and they never wished for a better colleague and boss in their banking days.  Tears streamed from my eyes as l read Abba Kyari's daughter. The man she sought to make us see was lost the day he became the Chief of Staff. Though he remained a loving father but never again a man for Nigerians. You cannot be for Buhari and be for Nigerians. If you doubt me, ask our wailing nation about his hailers. It takes a whole lot of sacrifice to work for or be on the side of the President. Those who treasure personal values and patriotism to our nation will find it hard to fit into Buhari's line of duty. 
 
 The media has been awash with the profile of Ibrahim Gambari, the new Chief of Staff to the President. By qualifications, he is for me over qualified. He is one of the best alive today who could serve the President in that capacity. But the issue is beyond papers and exposure. It is about HEART and CHARACTER. Who is Ibrahim ""Agboola"" Gambari? The mischief that saw Agboola inserted in the image laundering that have greeted the public space should suggest something to us. The struggle to dress a Fulani protégée whose fore fathers conquered Ilorin Afonja in ""Gbariye"" to make him a Yoruba man is an affront to our sense of history and sensibility as a nation. I never expected the President to appoint someone of another tribe or religion apart from his. But whoever that person was going to be must be one whose mind can be traded. The peril of the First lady, Aisha in this administration is her inability to be lost in the myopic world view of her husband. She must therefore be dutiful in the kitchen and the ""oza"" room. That should permanent bury the fate of the girl child in Buhari's Presidency. I have seen tons of articles from sincerely concerned Nigerians about Ibrahim Gambari. One that caught my attention is written by Revolutionist Omoyele Sowore whose binocular lenses captured Gambari from his counter role against the people's struggle to have June 12 revalidated. Sowore placed before us a Fulani Prince and intellectual diplomat without apology to the commoner for his despicable role at championing and stabilising Abacha's tyrannical reign over the rest of us. With doors of America and Europe closed against Abacha during his reign, I am still trying to find the role of this member of the oligarch in the transfer of ""assets"" to Europe and America from which we have been graciously receiving alerts from our departed brutal king, who at death turned out to be a very ""generous"" ancestor and benefactor. Insha Allah, may Mohammadu Buhari be as kind hereafter. Who is Ibrahim Gambari? He was the youngest Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1984/85 under Buhari. A peep into the foreign policy drive of that era will tell you who the man is. Gambari is an Islamist without apologies. The frosty relationship and unrenewed ties with Israel with him in the saddle as the Foreign Minister was a testimony of his legacy and what to expect from him as Chief of Staff. Not even Egypt left the need to renew ties with Israel unattended. But our Fulani Head of State and his Foreign Minister will have nothing to do with the nation of Jehovah. They saw an ally in Yasser Arafat and his terrorist Palestinian Liberation Organisation known for deadly terror attacks on the world at that time. Our Mohammadu Buhari was a darling friend of Arafat and our country a supporter of the PLO agenda. Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is known for his penchant and prowess at picking men for duties: square peg in square holes to Government for good governance. General Mohammadu Buhari on the other hand is best at finding the ""best of us"": round pegs in round holes, who can with impunity round up the rest of us and effectively consricpt us for whatever agenda Buhari deems fit. The personality of Ibrahim Gambari is essentially inconsequential to the duty at hand. We should be more concerned about who and what Mohammadu Buhari make of him in the remaining years and months of this regrettable misadministration. It should all be about the man we gave our mandate and not the hands he hires to have his job done.  I will like to congratulate the President for finding a profile and person better than the immediate past Chief of Staff while also congratulating Professor Ibrahim AGBOOLA Gambari on his appointment. Our fate in the days ahead is sealed as per what to expect from him and his principal. But not our faith! For the powers that be are ordained of God and by him actions are weighed. Both Buhari and Gambari should be reminded that both time and eternity shall bring to remembrance their days in power. I wish my readers and all Nigerians particularly those at home a new grace of endurance till 2023."

The sitting judge, Justice Abdulaziz Waziri, vacated his own order, saying: ""Election is a constitutional matter; this court would not be used to breach the process.” The judge however assumed jurisdiction to entertain the matter and adjourned to Wednesday March 27 2019 for hearing on the originating summon. Meanwhile, Ahmed Umar Fintiri, who is the leading contender in the governorship race and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have applied and have been joined as second and third defendants to the suit. Reacting to the ruling, counsel to the second and third defendants, Joe Kyari Gadzama (SAN), said: ""Half bread is better than none; the judge has vacated the ex parte order but assumed jurisdiction in the substantive matter. ""I was at the Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday when the ruling about Bauchi governorship election was delivered and I've applied for a copy of the judgment to help guide his lordship on this matter.” SaharaReporters can report that with this development, the coast has been cleared for the supplementary governorship election to hold.

Opinion,The Ibrahim Gambari I Know By Festus Ogun,"2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/15/ibrahim-gambari-i-know-festus-ogun,"Let me hasten in congratulating Prof Ibrahim Gambari, the newly appointed Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, who replaces the late Abba Kyari. As jubilations all over the place continue, it is important to sound a note of warning to all Nigerians that it is not yet uhuru. Truly, Prof Gambari is an experienced diplomat. However, I feel it impulsive to remind Nigerians that we must never throw caution to the wind; there is a looming danger ahead! As a citizen, who is most concerned about how our country’s leadership upholds the sanctity of the rule of law, constitutional democracy and respects for human rights, I have since become very buffled about the appointment of Prof Gambari. My fear is premised upon the facts that: one, the Buhari administration is notorious for gross human rights violations and the subversion of our hard-earned constitutional democracy and two, Prof Gambari’s records on human rights matters, democracy and the rule of law are too gory for the sight of history. Prof Gambari, a brilliant and intelligent man, was a staunch supporter of the draconian regime of late General Sani Abacha when he served as Nigeria’s Permanent Representative at the United Nations. He never for once pretended in his supportive positions during the locust years Abacha almost destroyed Nigeria. He was busy making conscious efforts in painting the devil a saint in the international scene. 
 
 He supported and justified the judicial murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others fighting for the environmental rights of the Ogoni people. He defended the evils of Abacha and described the executed activists as “common criminals”. Despite all the repressions, dehumanisations and sponsored assassinations, Prof Gambari told the whole world that Abacha “has not oppressed anyone”, adding that the activists fighting for the democracy we are ‘enjoying’ today, were being arrested “because the survival of Nigeria is paramount”. He defended and supported the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election, the most transparent election in our national history that was victoriously won by the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola, who was later killed by the Nigerian state. In fact, he was not in support of Nigeria’s return to democracy at a time when the whole world was agitating that the people of Nigeria should be entitled to determine who lead them. In the heat of dictatorship, Prof Gambari held the opinion that Nigeria was not yet ripe for democracy. He said “Nigeria’s problems are not fully understood by those who ought to know better. You cannot bring democracy overnight. You cannot export democracy”. Worryingly, he openly opposed the renaming of a New York street after Kudirat Abiola, who was assassinated by Abacha boys. That is to show the extent he went to protect the satanic interest of the most brutal dictator in the Nigerian history. I can continue to point out his disdain for the rule of law and constitutional democracy. I can continue to talk about his love and support for dictatorship and abuse of human rights. But, I will stop at this juncture because the few instances I highlighted above are enough to drive home my point. For someone that supported the judicial killing of human rights activists and opposed anything that has to do with democracy and human rights, we all have reasons to be afraid of the years to come. I am making this piece for the interest of my generation, who knows little or nothing about the Nigerian history. History, they say, justifies confidence. Unfortunately, the rulers of our nation deliberately expunged history from our school’s syllabus so that the coming generations would not be aware of the evils they have perpetrated and how they brought the nation to its knees. The “de-weaponization” of history, I call it! Little wonder why my generation is weak, too conforming and appears ‘uninterested’ in how the country is being run. Blame them not; a generation that was deliberately made ignorant of history will inevitably be infected by cowardice and docility. Whether President Buhari is right or wrong in appointing an old man like himself as Chief of Staff is not my worry. I really do not know why Nigerians are still surprised that a gerontocrat went extra miles to pick someone who would dance to his despotic rhythms. Being a despot is the only road Buhari knows, one expects he follows the easiest route.  What will be the state of human rights, rule of law and constitutional democracy in Nigeria in the next few years with the appointment of a renowned supporter of fascism, bearing in mind the fact that the above mentioned are the pillars of democracy? Being brilliant or being an experienced intellect is not enough criterion to be a democrat; believing in the ideals of democracy and having a record of supporting same is the only criterion I know.  As much as I wish Prof Gambari well in his new position, I will rather choose to be realistic than optimistic about my expectations of him. Well meaning Nigerians and conscious activists should be well prepared for the years ahead.  In the end, may Nigeria win."
Opinion,"Hanan Buhari's Sim Card, The Burden Of Deterrence And The Monstrous S. 84 Of The Sheriff And Civil Processes Act By Peniela E. Akintujoye Esq.","1 Day Ago
",/2020/05/15/hanan-buharis-sim-card-burden-deterrence-and-monstrous-s-84-sheriff-and-civil-processes,"First, I'd like to congratulate Mr. Anthony Okolie, Mr. Omoyele Sowore and my brother and comrade, Tope Akinyode Esq. on the well won victory against the State Security Service (SSS) - by the way from the records, the most lawless security agency in our country - who had at the instance of the Presidency instigated the arrest of Mr. Okolie and detained him unlawfully for 10 weeks for lawfully purchasing a sim card once used by Hanan, the President's daughter. That was all his offence. This will go down in history as one of the most ignominious actions of the Buhari presidency.  And by the way we were told that Mr. Okolie was even lucky for being detained for just ten weeks when there are people who have been detained for two years without trial and without any clue for their family to even trace them (in essence, kidnapped); courtesy of this lawless agency.  The Federal high court Asaba Division, by its judgement of 14th May, 2020 has now awarded the sum of ten million naira against the State Security Service for the gross abuse of the Applicant's right. We commend the court. 
 
 The uninitiated should please note that the essence of such monetary award in favour of a victim of right abuse is to serve two purposes to wit: compensate him for his pain as a result of the abuse and to serve as a deterrence to the agency of government or individual who had abused his right.  The reasoning is that, every one feels the pain of losing hard-earned money; and so a person (natural or artificial) who is compelled to pay compensation of, for instance ten million naira as in this case will be discouraged from repeating the misconduct in the future for fear of further economic losses.  The reality however is that by virtue of the provision of S. 84 of the Sheriffs and Civil Processes Act (SCPA), it has become permanently impossible over the decades to get government and its agencies to pay up such compensation as the ten million naira awarded in this case.  The implication of this is that the victim gets nothing at the end of the day as compensation for the abuse - and note that right abuses in certain situations lead to permanent incapacitation of the victim and sometimes death - and then more wearisomely, the abuser is never deterred.  Fellow Nigerians, in case you never knew, this situation occasioned by S. 84 of SCPA is arguably the greatest reason why security agencies in this country continue to grow more and more monstrous in abusing the rights of ordinary Nigerians on daily basis.  By the way, that S. 84 to explain it in a lay man's language requires that before you can take the money belonging to a government agency in the custody of a public officer (usually the Central Bank of Nigeria especially in this age of Treasury Single Account) to satisfy an amount awarded in your favour as damages for the abuse of your right, you need to first get the consent of the Attorney General of the Federation or State.  Remember, the Attorney General is an appointee of the same government which controls the police, the SSS, and other security agencies that you're trying to enforce the judgment against. In practise, the Attorney General will never give you the consent. So at the end you get no justice. And worse still, you'll likely be abused more in the future because your abuser knowing there won't be any consequences is more emboldened to act with greater impunity.  If you understand the implications of the foregoing, you will agree with me that perhaps the most important war that the entire human right community and ordinary Nigerians must rally to win quickly for the abolition of the high-handedness, impunity and oppression of security agencies (and other government agencies generally) in our country is the war to kill S. 84 of the SCPA. Every other step we take to redress abuses in court will continue to be as good as wasted efforts as long as at the end of the day, we will neither get the needed justice nor deter the abusers.  I doubt if public embarrassment which this judgment serves on an agency like the SSS is able to achieve the purpose of deterrence compared to if for instance, the SSS will really lose ten million naira to Mr. Okolie when the judgement is executed in a few months. And I doubt if the mere fact that a court verbally pronounces an action illegal can serve justice to a victim who for instance lost his limb in the process of the abuse compared to if he is able to recover the sum awarded and at least able to use it to fix the relic of his destabilised life.  To be clear, by this article, I am inviting the human right community and all Nigerians to declare a fresh war on S. 84 of the Sheriffs and Civil Processes Act. We must explore both the legislative and judicial options.  The efforts of several lawyers and human right advocates to get the courts to declare S. 84 unconstitutional over the years must at this point be commended. We need to revisit this strategy and sustain it because we are almost winning the war. Already we have gotten several recent Court of Appeal judgments that have declared S. 84 as unconstitutional by virtue of S. 1(3), 6(6), 36 and 287 of the 1999 Constitution. Unfortunately there are also recent Court of Appeal judgments that declared it constitutional.  Everyone is looking on the Supreme Court to make a decision that will lay the matter to rest. In CBN Vs. Interstellar Communications Limited & Ors. (2018) 7 NWLR (Part 1618) 294, the Supreme Court had that opportunity to finally bury S. 84. It unfortunately did not, but thankfully did a lot of damage to the ""monster"" so that it is currently arguably standing on one leg. With some extra determined push, we should be winning the battle.  I have personally perused the decision of the Court of Appeal in Onjewu Vs. Kogi State Ministry of Commerce and Industry & Ors. ( 2003) 10 NWLR [pt. 827]40 which is the most popular decision preserving S. 84 and I'm convinced that the rationale for the decision of my Lords which may have been valid at the time the decision was given are currently totally flawed. I will write comprehensively on this point shortly and we are also warming up through the Civic Engagement and Justice Coalition (CJC) to approach the court with the arguments. While we continue to push the judicial option, we must rally the National Assembly with fresh vigour to repeal outright S. 84. Apart from the Human Right angle, that law is a total disincentive to both local and foreign investors who would have otherwise loved to do business with the government. If the government breaches the contract they have with them and they are forced to go to court, they too need consent of the Attorney General to be able to enforce the judgment and recover their investment. No smart investor will take on such humongous risk.  I will like to close with a popular statement of our struggle when we were still student activists back at the Obafemi Awolowo University: ""if we fight, we may win; but if we do not fight, we have already lost."" Amandla Awetu. "
Opinion,Octogenarian Buhari Appoints Septuagenarian Gambari As Chief Of Staff By Bayo Oluwasanmi,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/octogenarian-buhari-appoints-septuagenarian-gambari-chief-staff-bayo-oluwasanmi,"When President Muhammadu Buhari signed the not-too-young to rule into law, Nigerian youth went frenzy. But every appointment made by Buhari makes mockery of the law. From bungled decisions and actions taken by Buhari on critical national and international issues, it is evident that there’s leadership age gap disconnect between him and Nigerian youth. The exclusion of youths from high political positions effectively debunks the cliche that “youths are the leaders of tomorrow.” Youths make up the majority of our demography, yet they remain stunted at best and stifled at worst at the bottom of our political leadership while the octogenarians control the levers of power. We should not expect anything progressive, purposeful, and productive from Ibrahim Gambari as Chief of Staff. Why does Buhari keeps appointing people who are at their departure lounge of life to important positions? Buhari appoints people he “trusts” and people who share his reactionary world view to progressivism. He’s comfortable with people who can advance Fulani agenda that’s rooted in hegemony, terrorism, barbarism, and tyranny. He appoints people who will pursue his vision of taking Nigeria back further into the dark ages of tyranny, poverty, disease, and ignorance. Of course, he selects those who will serve as conduits of corruption and malfeasance that will funnel our common wealth to the Northerners. 
 
 Gambari is over qualified to inject new blood to the reign of terror – the hallmark of Buhari’s presidency. Gambari comes to Aso Rock with impressive resume as an advocate of military dictatorship and as a fierce opponent of democracy and civil liberties. Here’s Gambari’s abbreviated resume: He publicly and vigorously supported and defended General Sani Abacha for the execution of Ogoni environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and other eight Ogoni acitivists. He labelled Saro-Wiwa a “common criminal.” He supported and encouraged the gap-tooth dictator, Ibrahim Babangida, to annul the 1993 presidential election that gave victory to MKO Abiola. The election was the freest and fairest election in the history of Nigeria. As a relentless and vocal supporter of military dictatorships, he argued that “Nigerians don’t need democracy because democracy is not food. It is not the priority now.” He has always been a reliable, dependable, loyal, and close adviser to all dictators that ever ruled Nigeria. He favours dictatorship over democracy. Gambari like Buhari won’t be able to exercise or retain the alertness needed for his job. Similarly, Gambari will provide clouded vision unsuitable for the pace, expectations, and civilisation of our time. Gambari will fail to shape or influence any policy or program by Buhari to deliver on the expectations of Nigerians. Gambari, who ought to be enjoying his retirement with his grandchildren is now saddled with running a dysfunctional, insensitive, and tone-deaf Aso Rock. Gambari’s appointment underscores the comedy of errors that Buhari’s presidency is famous for. Gambari, who is well known for his primitive, divisive, and oppressive politics, as Chief of Staff, he’ll religiously pursue politics of confusion fully anchored on bigotry, division, polarisation, intolerance, hate, and exclusion. Gambari will hit the ground running in pursuing the ancient evils of Buhari for Nigeria. With Buhari as President and Gambari as Chief of Staff, the expectation that the government should create economic, political, and social policies for future and fortune of Nigerians is sealed for the next four years. This is how octogenarian Buhari and septuagenarian Gambari will revive the land of the living dead!  "

Opinion,How The North Can Truly End Almajiri System By Olabisi Deji-Folutile,"3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/how-north-can-truly-end-almajiri-system-olabisi-deji-folutile,"I don’t think anyone can doubt the commitment of Governor Nasir el-Rufai to ending the practice of almajiri system in Kaduna State. Give it to him, his actions of late have shown that he is indeed tired of seeing child beggars on the streets of Northern states. He didn’t mince his words either in a recent interview on Channels Television when he talked about leaving other Northern governors behind should they decide to continue to treat the issue with levity. To him, that would be the governors’ business. But as far as he is concerned, the system is dead in Kaduna State. That was probably the first time any Northern governor would be emphatic about ending the age-long tradition in the region. To further prove that he meant business, he said the state had expanded its school capacity to integrate the freshly transferred Almajiris from other states into formal schools. According to him, the state has also reviewed the law that will formally prohibit the system.   Ordinarily, no governor should be celebrated for promising to enrol out-of-school children in school. After all, the Universal Basic Education Act of 2004 makes it compulsory for children to have compulsory nine years education. But it is obvious that our leaders choose the laws to implement and the ones to ignore. The Northern governors in particular have always talked about integrating the almajiri system into formal education, but the children have always been on the streets. It was not until a few weeks back that the Kano State Government decided to send child beggars in the state back to their home states. 
 
 Other states in the North also did the same thing and somehow, it’s been a season of transfer and counter transfer of almajiris amidst ban on interstate movements by the Federal Government.  I may not support the way the children are being transported from one state to the other, especially at a time of a serious health pandemic like COVID-19, it is at least heart-warming that the governors are owning up to their  problem and trying to take responsibility.  However, these governors would be deceiving themselves if they think that a mere transfer of kid beggars to their home states will solve the problem of street begging and illiteracy in their states. It goes beyond that. Education is just a means to an end. What happens when these children graduate from school? What plans are the governors making in terms of creating employment opportunities for them?  What are the moves being made now to expand the states’ economies and provide business opportunities outside of government jobs? The governors must have a plan in place to sustain the army of children being born in the region on daily basis? Can the resources in these states match the current rate of population growth? These are valid questions that should be answered. I doubt if there is any northern state expanding economically at the rate at which its population is growing at present. I am concerned about a region that has kept on breeding children as if they are going out of fashion and yet increasingly depending on  federal allocation for survival. That is why I   think the governors may have to confront the problem of overpopulation in the north once and for all. I know that some people believe that the north deliberately allows its people to have many children in order to gain electoral advantage over other parts of the country. They think the huge population figures often work wonders especially during elections. Besides, they argue that these small children are handy when politicians want to foment trouble. Unfortunately, in reality, high population figures also connote great responsibilities. That is probably why some states would rather they keep the figures controlled than overstretch their resources. Does the north want the region to keep breeding at an uncontrolled rate or does it want children that it can adequately cater for?  Understandably, any conversation on population reduction can be tough, delicate and controversial especially in a region steeped in religion and tradition. Or, how for instance, do you tell a Muslim not to marry more than one wife or have as many children as he wants more so when the Holy Book sanctions it?  But, truth be told, there is no escape route to this conversation. So, the sooner the governors address the situation, the better things would be for the region and by extension, the rest of the country. It should be obvious to all by now that governors in other parts of the country are weary of allowing the almajiris in the north to escape to their states. Nobody wants to pay the price of uncontrolled births in the north. That is why some of them mount checks at their entry points to prevent these children from escaping to their territories. There are instances where some governors personally check vehicles carrying food items to be sure that these children are not hiding under the goods. Amazingly, some of these children have been caught hiding under goats and all kinds of stuffs in their bid to escape to other parts of the country.   To imagine that this is still the case in a country that launched its first population control policy as far back as 1988, is unbelievable! More than 30 years ago, the policy had recommended an average of four children per family, marriage age of 18 for women and 24 for men. It had also advocated that pregnancies should be restricted to 18-35-year age range and at intervals of two years. I remember that a former military leader, General Ibrahim Babangida, led a popular campaign of four children per family during his regime as head of state. Similarly, in 2012, former President Goodluck Jonathan tried to encourage legislation on birth control. Unfortunately, the two of them did not achieve much success in this regard. Today, there are places in this country where you dare not talk about child spacing or birth control.   Honestly, this country is a hypocritical and highly religious society. Christians will tell you that God commands them to reproduce and fill the earth, never mind there are several aspects of their lives where they conveniently ignore God’s instructions. Likewise, the Muslims will claim that the Quran permits a man to marry up to four wives. These men will also cleverly remain silent on the precondition for marrying more than one wife --loving the women equally. I stand to be corrected, but I don’t know how a man can love two women equally. The other time, a lawmaker had the temerity of parading his four wives and 27 children at the National Assembly.  Imagine a lawmaker publicly flaunting such in a country that is supposed to have a population policy of four children per family. Let’s be frank with ourselves, how many men can truly take care of 27 children and four wives under the current economic realities in today’s Nigeria?   The time has come for northern governors to lead the campaign on population control. Religious leaders should stop preaching that men should marry more than one wife. All the talk about the Holy Book saying a girl shouldn’t start her menstrual circle in her father’s house is only a message for the poor. How many rich people’s children have their first menstruation in their husbands’ houses? I don’t think persuasion can achieve the kind of results expected here. Therefore, the governors may, for instance, enact a law, restricting the number of children that a family could have to four.  An average woman in the north could give birth to seven children whereas her counterpart in the south west may not have more than four children. By the time a man married to four wives, has seven from each wife, the children become 28. Is that not outrageous? A report by the United Nations Population Division has predicted that Nigeria’s population will double to over 400 million by 2050. The population is said to be growing at between 2.6-2.8 per annum while our GDP has been on a constant decline. When you have more mouths to feed than available resources, you don’t need a seer to tell you that you will end up in penury. The population growth in the north is not sustainable. If the north continues to allow its people to give birth to children without restraint, the state will keep bearing the burden since   hapless parents will keep abdicating their responsibilities to the state. For how long can a state take care of children born without planning?   Even if we don’t want to follow the model of the developed world in terms of their small family structure; we can at least take a leaf from them in terms of how they are managing their population in relationship to their resources thereby enhancing the well being of their citizens.   "
Opinion,"The Palliatives Regime: Questions And Suggestions By John Danfulani, Ph.D","2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/palliatives-regime-questions-and-suggestions-john-danfulani-phd,"The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management is a key player in the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. The ministry is manning the flank  responsible for implementing palliative policies designed to cushion the apocalyptic consequences the pandemic inflected on economic backbone of poor households in Nigeria.  Incorporating national economic institutions, ministries, and bodies responsible for welfare related matters in COVID-19 management teams has a global pattern. In the US, Capitol appropriated over $2trn to support businesses and people that were thrown out of jobs because of the pandemic. In the Western world, welfare institutions received additional financial backings from their governments and donors. In April of 2020, the MHADM bankrolled its first COVID-19 economic palliative scheme. MHADM claimed that 2.6m vulnerable households got N20,000 in cash or transfers into their bank accounts. The MHADM piqued, they used a data base of the poorest Nigerians from the Social National Register they compiled and released on 30th March 2020. And the SIP data that has been existing since 2016. 
 
 The MHADM commenced another scheme: feeding kids in their homes on Thursday 14th May 2020. Hajiya Sadiya Farooq, Minister of the MHADM announced that the feeding regime will gulp N13bn monthly. A rough  breakdown of the figure shows that they will spend N679m daily. The programme covered 31 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory.  The MHADM's palliatives have generated negative reactions from; pressure groups, organised labour, social commentators, opposition juggernauts and their parties, and elected personas. These clusters and individuals raised fundamental questions surrounding the philosophy behind the MHADM's decisions and their executions. The most damning criticism of the first palliative came from Sen. Ali Ndume (APC Borno) a member of the ruling party. He labelled the scheme a monumental fraud, in its entirety. The senator inflicted uppercut punches on the MHADM’s fundamental declations and statistics of the beneficiaries. Distinguished Ndume landed by beseeching President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately pull the brakes on MHADM's intervention projects. More, the social media was saturated with protests and inquiries of evidences of payments and beneficiaries. They refused to be hoodwinked or bamboozled with photos ops of affluent suburban women collecting money in different locations from the minister or her teams. Many asked their followers to search and report a single poor that truly benefitted from the scheme. Nobody got a feedback of a Nigerian that got cash or alert from his bankers. Criticism that accompanied MHADM's  decisions and actions are quintessential and worth pondering on. Poignant questions like :a) are the palliatives necessary vis a vis the challenge on our economic base?; b) are the timings right considering the fact that most of the country was/is on a lockdown?; c) how are their exercises rolling in tandem with NCDC guidelines of social distancing and anti-large gathering? ; and (d how credible and reliable are the data on the poor households in Nigeria? A walk through these posers will leave no soul with a spec of doubt that; the  philosophy was wrongly conceived and catastrophically executed.  The 2019 statistics from UNDP, World Bank and others shows that over 91m Nigerians live in extreme poverty. COVID-19 has undoubtedly expanded  the percentage dramatically. With this, what difference has the controversial N20,000 to 2.6m poor households made? What is the fate of over 100m wretched Nigerians that the palliatives didn’t cover? Above all, was the money a support to their businesses or a gesture to restock food banks of the so-called beneficiaries? Concerns are being raised on the home feeding scheme they started on 14th May 2020. Many states are in total lockdown, thus schools are shutdown. How is the food reaching kids scattered in cities and remotest areas in Nigeria? Who supervised the sanitary and nutritional aspect of the meals being served? How will this be executed without violating basic NCDC principles of social distancing ? When did they recruit food vendors and the distribution teams? Again, a careful look at the single and double barrel questions posed will convince doubting Thomases  that; this programme will be a gargantuan disaster. Aside the unfortunate economic squandermania, lives of kids and parent will be expose to avoidable dangers.  MHADM's palliatives regime is misplaced, misguided, and an unmitigated catastrophe . A fraction of the money should have been invested in educating Nigerians on basic safety measures against the disease. The comatose National Orientation Agency, and some agencies of the federal ministry of information should get financial support  from PTF on Covid-19, and directive to go on mass education of Nigerians. The knowledge they will equip citizens with will enable them avoid habits that will expose them and others to the killer disease. It will excuse us the horror of seeing thousands of people ignorantly attending burials of covid-19 victims without protective kits. Or attending large gatherings in the name of worship and other social activities like naming ceremonies and weddings.  The remaining billions should go into immediate procurement of medical equipment and setting up of COVID-19 centres in all federal medical centres and some teaching hospitals. Experts postulated that N250m can set up a standard  medical facility with ventilators and other essentials desirable in ICUs. Break the billions misapplied in projects in focus, and see the number of standard medical centres we will have in Nigeria.  It is time we wise up and get going on the path of development and growth. This and multiple misplaced, misguided, and selfish decisions are factors responsible for making a country with a gargantuan reserve of human capital and natural resources a basket case. And the headquarters of negativities and sorrows in the world.  We were projected to be one of the success stories of the 20th century. Poor decisions by rulers and leaders rocked the boat. The same leaders are starting our 21st century journey on quicksand.   Sequel to reasons advanced herein, I urge the President to stop most activities of the palliative department of the PTF on COVID-19. They are wasting our scarce resources and widening the gap of distrust between government and the governed. And de-marketing believe in the dictum that democratic governments are sensitive and better managers of economies and nations. "
Opinion,Sonala Strikes Sixty-Five By Uzor Maxim Uzoatu,"2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/15/sonala-strikes-sixty-five-uzor-maxim-uzoatu,"Friday, May 15, in this Corona-tainted year of 2020 marks the 65th birthday of the inimitable journalist’s journalist Sonala Olumhense. I doubt that I would ever have become a journalist if not for my eventful meeting with the man called SO, or to put it in a more hip and contemporary vein, EssOh! It was at Rutam House in Lagos that I appeared in the dying months of 1985 to gun for a place as a journalist in The Guardian, and then met the man. My only recommendation was that I had published some articles on the esteemed OP-ED pages of The Guardian which Sonala edited. The then newly-employed Krees Imodibie, who was later murdered by Charles Taylor in Liberia, led me to the office of the Editorial Page Editor, Sonala Olumhense. 
 
 When I got introduced to Sonala, whom I was meeting for the very first time, he queried me like an accused person thus: “So you are the one?” In a mumbled rush I told him I had come to look for a job. He just waved for me to sit on the settee to his right and threw the bunch of the newspapers of the day on my lap. Sonala’s entire office table was stacked up with articles asking to be published on the OP-ED pages – some typed and many written in longhand. People came and left the office at will, calling him “Ess Oh” whilst he assessed the articles and I was engrossed with reading the newspapers. Whenever he read a particularly pathetic article, he would scream and toss the piece to me for my perusal. He was so free with me, treating me as though he had known me all his life. I kept wondering if he still remembered that I had come to look for a job. It was well into the evening that he suddenly stood up and said to me: “Let’s go.” I followed him to the office of the then Guardian editor, Lade Bonuola, the renowned Ladbone, who explained that the management had ended all recruitment such that no spaces were left for wannabes like me. Then Sonala took me upstairs to the about-to-be-established African Guardian magazine. He had a brief chat with the proposed magazine’s editor, Ted Iwere, who said he needed to set a test for me to know if I was up to par for the job. Sonala looked at me and at Ted, and then smiled as though somewhat assured they were wasting their time by putting me to a test! “When you are through with their test I’m downstairs waiting,” Sonala said and left. Ted Iwere asked me if I knew anything about the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting then holding in Nassau, Bahamas. I told him an instant “Yes” because news of the meeting was on the front pages of all the newspapers I had been reading downstairs in Sonala’s office. “Do a report of the meeting,” Ted said, adding that I should go to the library downstairs to do the writing. He graciously gave me off-cut paper and pen, and went back into his office. I could not understand it all. How do you ask someone to do an examination inside a library, and without an invigilator? Especially as Sonala in my suspicion had already surreptitiously made me to read up the material in question in his office? This simply amounted to “expo” in popular parlance. I decided there and then to write the assignment under “newsroom temperature” by refusing the advantage of going to the library given to me by Ted Iwere. I made noises while writing in the African Guardian newsroom to show that I had not gone to any library to cheat by spying through the newspapers. I submitted the assignment in under an hour and left. When I came back the next day Sonala made no mention of the test, or the result, which left me confused. I ran up to the African Guardian section, and nobody was forthcoming with the result of my test. I settled inside the newsroom, waiting for the worst, until the Editor-in-Chief, Andy Akporugo, strolled in and stared fixedly at me, saying: “Don’t think you are too hot; I will simply chuck you out!” Now this was beyond my understanding: I had not even been employed yet the boss was already talking of sending me packing. I was still in a daze when the magazine’s artists, Femi Jolaosho (now Jolaolu) and Jide Fatogun, told me that the test I did the day before had already been pasted up for publication in the maiden edition of the magazine. Thanks to Sonala, my first test as a journalist ended up being published in the first edition of the African Guardian where I had great company in the assembled eminent staff, notably Pini Jason, Ashikiwe Adione-Egom the Motor-Park Economist, Greg Obong-Oshotse, Okey Ndibe, Emmanuel Aguariavwedo, Seun Sonoiki, Kingsley Osadolor, Fred Ohwahwa, Joni Akpederi, Ada Momah, Ngozi Ojidoh, George Ola-Davies, Ola Alakija, Stanley Amah, Jossey Ogbuanoh etc When Nduka Obaigbena started out with his magazine THISWEEK, with Sonala as the founding Editor, there was no need for me to write a test before being signed up as a pioneer staff. Sonala wanted me on board, and when I met the publisher Nduka Obaigbena he was talking of negotiating my salary only for me to just ask him: “When are we getting started?” “You are a believer,” Nduka said and signed me on the spot. It was a happy time in which Sonala always put me up in a hotel with lofty supply of booze on the nights I had to write cover stories. I got a promotion from Sonala and his great friend Tunji Lardner, my head of department, when I wrote a story on one worse-than-useless superman called Super Dee, even as I had originally been sent out to the National Stadium to write big sports stories on worthy stars. Incidentally one of the sports stories I wrote entitled “The Match That Broke The Myth” was included in the Intensive English textbook for WASC students. When Nduka Obaigbena came up with dreams like “Nigeria in the next 100 years”, Sonala replied that he was more interested in “THISWEEK in the next one week than Nigeria in the next 100 years”! After leaving THISWEEK, Sonala blazed the trail of publishing a for-Lagos-only city newspaper called City Tempo in which I was equally a pioneer staff. But for paucity of support funds we would have shaken awake the world of publishing with inflammably exclusive stories like asking celebrities such as Fela, Sunny Ade, Christy Essien-Igbokwe etc the pointed question: “Where do you like to do?” Sonala is the author of the critically-acclaimed novel No Second Chancepublished by Longmans and translated into Russian and other languages. Sonala eventually moved to the United States where he still reigns as Nigeria’s ultimate syndicated columnist, Sonala Olumhense Syndicated (SOS)! In one of his recent visits to Nigeria, Sonala and I stayed in an Ikeja hotel to work on Ogbuefi Tony Nnachetta’s coffee table book on the Super Eagles of Nigeria entitled “Class of 94.” Let’s raise the roof with the toast of 65 cheers to the indomitable guru hailed famously as EssOh!"
Elections,'50 Political Parties' Queue Up Behind Ganduje After Controversial Kano Governorship Election,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/03/27/50-political-parties-queue-behind-ganduje-after-controversial-kano-governorship-election,"About 50 political parties have lent their support to the reelection of Abdullahi Ganduje, Governor of Kano State, in the just-concluded governorship election. This was contained in a media statement signed by Abba Anwar, Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, and made available to the media on Wednesday. The parties also dismissed a call by some parties for the cancellation of the result, stating that it was a “misconstrued approach and a mere defeatist standpoint by some elements that are not even regarded as serious politicians”. According to the statement, the parties “expressed disgust that none of their parties that were included in the list of parties calling for the cancellation of Kano gubernatorial election result was contacted before putting them on the list”. Among the parties that pitched tent with Ganduje are AAP, UPC, ADC, NAC, NEPP, NUP, RPN, AD, SDP, ACD, NRM, and APM. Gaya, who spoke on behalf of other parties, said the elections were free, fair and credible, “with some insignificant and unavoidable hiccups that are natural for any election”. “It was even reported by Deputy Inspector of Police Anthony Michael in one of his live interviews with Channels TV when the election was on, that it was peaceful and there was no reported case of thuggery,"" he said. ""He added that even accredited election observers such as Ibrahim Baba (mni) testified to that. As such we are therefore supporting the outcome of the election at whatever length. Ours is to now continue giving our helping hand for him to succeed again in developing the state."" Ganduje won the Kano State governorship election, polling 1,033,695 votes against 1,024,713 votes secured by Abba Yusuf of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), meaning he won with aslim  margin of 8,982 votes.  However, the election was marred by incidents of violence and voter intimidation and disenfranchisement, underage voting and ballot box snatching"

Opinion,COVID-19 And Snake Oil Salesmanship In Nigeria By Leo Igwe,"2 Days Ago
",/2020/05/15/covid-19-and-snake-oil-salesmanship-nigeria-leo-igwe,"As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, and the search for a vaccine continues, many people are gullible and are easily swayed by peddlers of cures or solutions.There is so much fear and uncertainty in the communities. People are hoping for some miracle or magical remedy. However, charlatans are having a field day in places such as Nigeria. They are marketing all sorts of concoction and treatment even as scientists are still trying to understand the nature of the virus. Quacks are mining people's desperation and vulnerability. Snake oil salesmanship is pervasive. Incidentally at the forefront of the health care fraudulent schemes are pastors and churches, and other marketers of spiritual solutions. Recently, a pentecostal pastor, Apostle Suleman, claimed that he could heal COVID19 patients. He appealed to the government to allow him  into the isolation centers so that he could exercise his faith healing powers. Apostle Suleman has been challenged to demonstrate his faith healing abilities. He has been asked to heal a COVID19 patient and get five thousand dollars. However, this pastor has yet to accept the challenge to heal  a patient under agreed medical and scientific conditions. 
 
 Meanwhile another pentecostal pastor has come out with a spiritual solution to the pandemic. This pastor goes by a Facebook name, Goodheart Val Aloysius, also known as My Father My Father. Aloysius is marketing an anti COVID19 oil which he claims would provide people with spiritual immunity against the virus. Aloysius, who is also the owner of the Father's House International Church in Calabar, Cross River State, is a  . On his Facebook, Pastor Aloysius declares: "" .  A hundred US dollars is about forty thousand naira. 
 
 Faith healing claims are forms of medical quackery. They undermine evidence based efforts and guidelines for the management of the coronavirus and other health problems. In the case of the coronavirus pandemic, faith healing propositions confuse and misinform the people, and get them to conduct themselves as if there are cures and solutions when none exists. As in the case of My Father My Father, these faith remedies are not free. They cost money. In fact these spiritual goods are devices that these charlatans use to extort money from desperate individuals. NCDC should take all necessary measures to check the proliferation of faith healing schemes and help bring these snake oil salesmen to book."

At the issuance of certificates ceremony on Wednesday in the state, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) refused to issue them the certificates based on the recent court judgement that sacked the Great Ogboru/Ovie Omo-Agege faction of the state executive of APC led by Jones Erue, from which the three lawmakers-elect emerged. The lawmakers-elect are Anidi Emosivwe (Ethiope East constituency), Oniyere Whomrouho (Ughelli North I constituency) and Egbo Jaro (Ughelli North II constituency), While presenting the certificates of return to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa; his deputy, Kingsley Otuaro, and other House of Assembly members-elect who contested on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), at the INEC office in Asaba, Mohammed Lecky, the INEC National Commissioner, said their certificates were denied as a result of “pending legal issues”.

Opinion,Gombe COVID-19 Situation: A Show Of Shame And Ineptitude Of Governance By Salisu Abdullahi,"1 Day Ago
",/2020/05/16/gombe-covid-19-situation-show-shame-and-ineptitude-governance-salisu-abdullahi,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 in Gombe State has further exposed the ineptitude and lack of willpower on the part of the government. While many states like Kebbi, Lagos, Delta and Borno stand out with the quality of their preparedness with well-equipped isolation centres and testing facilities, such cannot be said of the management of this situation in Gombe, a state that prides itself with decent men and women of local and international reputations. Little wonder the governor had publicly threatened that he may resign his position because he is overwhelmed.  Before the pandemic, the state governor, Inuwa Yahaya, struggles everyday to convince the people of the progress he is making but each attempts portrays him and his cabinet as having failed woefully by all developmental indexes. The good works of the past administration is also being rubbished by the lack of vision and blueprint for the state, little wonder stakeholders concluded that Governor Inuwa Yahaya wasn’t ready for governance. The unfortunate incident where the COVID-19 patients simultaneously protested at the two designated isolation centres is highly condemnable. Despite the donations received by the task force and the funds spent by the government, yet the patients are still complaining over the poor quality of food they are eating and lack of medical equipment and drugs to cater for the patients. This raises more questions than answers. The health workers are also complaining about their unpaid allowances yet the state government claimed to have paid these frontline workers who are sacrificing their health and safety to ensure the recovery of the victims of the pandemic. The controversy over the transfer of 42 patients from Gombe to Adamawa State and the outright rebuttal of the story by Governor Fintiri depicts another shoddy way the whole issue is being handled. The report of human rights violation by the members of the vigilante group imposing the curfew in the state is another ugly and detestable happening. Everything worth doing, is worth doing well. Let the Gombe Government take its fight against COVID-19 with utmost seriousness it deserves. The more you play politics with it or take it as a money making venture, the more it exposes you. The COVID-19 patients kept at the Gombe isolation centre in the Prof Idris Muhammed Infections and Diseases Hospital, Kwadon in Yamaltu Deba Local Government Area, staged a demonstration lamenting their poor condition there. The protesters blocked the main road in front of the centre leading to the town. 
 
 One of the patients, who craved anonymity said they were protesting over the poor condition in which they were kept by the state tasks force on COVID-19. She said, “A lady among us has been critically sick with a cancer related illness and her leg has been swollen but she was not taken care of by the officials. She was brought to the centre alongside her sister and she demands to go home for proper treatment of her leg. “Since I was brought here, I don’t eat their poorly cooked food and I was neither given a capsule nor consulted by any health official, I wonder why they’ve decided to keep us here for their selfish gains.” Despite the defense of the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Ahmed Gana, the people expressed disappointment in the manner at which the state has handled the COVID crisis. The incompetence of the administration was further accentuated when Ismaila Misilli, a Senior Special Assistant (Media and Publicity) to Gombe State governor, made futile and blatant attempts to defend the governor. He claimed that even before Gombe State recorded its first COVID-19 case, Governor Yahaya had swung into action, mandating the establishment of several COVID-19 isolation centres complete with hundreds of bed spaces, sanitary facilities like running water, hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment for the health workers, ventilators, oxygen concentrators as well as a conducive working environment for the health workers to ensure that they were not infected by the index case and contact cases they were likely to treat. These claims were indeed lies. All states who took the crisis seriously showcased their different centres and these can be verified with just a search on social media and Google. Only a conscienceless individual can lay claim to what never existed like Ismaila did. In the long run, the index case in Gombe state has shown that the state has nothing to offer rather than mudslinging and propaganda and attacking all those who dare to challenge their actions and inactions. President Muhammadu Buhari and the Presidential Task Force should beam its searchlight on the failures of the state in cushioning the effects of the pandemic on the people. Proper accountability should be conducted for all the donations made by Gombe indigenes, corporate organisations and many others who had contributed fortunes to this course. May Almighty Allah help Gombe people to survive the remaining months of an administration that is bereft of ideas."
Opinion,"My Ibrahim Agboola Gambari Story By Babafemi A. Badejo, Ph.D","1 Day Ago
",/2020/05/16/my-ibrahim-agboola-gambari-story-babafemi-badejo-phd,"On May 12, 2020, news got leaked that Ibrahim Agboola Gambari, a quintessential and consummate bilateral and multilateral diplomat had been appointed as the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria. I tried to reach him to congratulate him but the number I had just rang till the normal disappointing announcement that asks to try later. So, I passed my greetings through a mutual friend who I know would deliver. That was it for me.  Then I started receiving congratulatory messages on the appointment of my benefactor from friends who knew that I know the new CoS. That’s not a problem. Three of the messages wasted no time in requesting that I ensure they got plum jobs. Then, in the evening, one of my classmates from my Ijebu-Ode Grammar School days posted a much circulated reaction of Ambassador Dapo Fafowora on the Gambari appointment that was yet to be announced. I read it with deep interest. Unfortunately, I had not read Ambassador Fafowora’s book: Lest I Forget, but his positive diplomatic pedigree and intellect I had heard much about and had listened to him speak impressively at one or two gatherings. I wrote on my classmates’ WhatsApp platform to the effect that Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari changed my life (and indirectly the lives of many through me). This is no news as anyone close to me would have heard in the past. I retorted that they must wait for whenever I am able to write my memoire if I ever write one. They know me from about age 12 and understand that I will not be seeking a job or contract for myself not to talk of anyone else. I woke up on the morning of May 13 feeling I must tell a bit of the Ibrahim Agboola Gambari part of my story. As I read more accounts during the day, I received two different calls from a senior and a friend became more convinced that I should make some part of my dream of a memoire public as at now. My write-up, this time around, is limited to my story of the Ibrahim Agboola Gambari that I know. 
 
 Retired General David Jemibewon as a graduate student at Unilag took a course that I taught. We got to like each other. I indicated interest in having international experience. He wrote a beautiful letter on me to Professor Gambari who was then the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations. I had tried to corner Gambari’s predecessor, late General Joe Garba, at an anti-apartheid meeting in Lagos. I was an activist those days. I was pushed aside by the Security guys. So, it was a big surprise that Prof. Gambari arrived in Lagos and called on my epileptic NITEL phone line asking myself and my wife to join him for breakfast at the Federal Government Guest House on Victoria Island. I wonder what became of all those villas that the country had at independence. Like the Federal Palace Hotel that Ibrahim Babangida and his Deputy, late Augustus Aikhomu, claimed to have sold on credit many moons ago, I wonder what had been the final stories on all those claims of privatization that distributed national patrimony to the most favoured for pittance. I had been told by another friend who knew late General Tunde Idiagbon and Prof. Gambari very closely as kids in Ilorin that his mother was a Yoruba woman. So, I had my Yoruba manners on but was shocked when he kept using the Yoruba equivalent of “vous” in French for me. That was not to be the case as Yorubas, since he was much older. I was later to know that that’s just him. To date, that has remained his unassuming humility towards all. He told me he had just resumed in New York and would look at what may be possible on my desire to work for the UN. That was it. However, as things would turn out, I became the local fulcrum for the quest of General Olusegun Obasanjo’s failed attempt to become the UN Secretary-General. Dr. Hans D’Orville, who had insisted I be the local leader in Nigeria, was the international fulcrum. Late Prof. Ade Adefuye, my big brother from my first day at Unilag as the first Faculty member I met and whose young age became an inspiration, agreed to be coopted. The Federal Government, about August 1991, appointed me as Special Assistant to General Obasanjo on his quest to be the Secretary-General. My own assessment was that the Federal Government was not interested in General Obasanjo becoming Secretary-General of the UN but President Babangida put some money behind the race. Obasanjo had been rightly very critical of the conditionality that the IMF had imposed on Nigeria after the patriotic Buhari/Idiagbon regime was overthrown by Babangida under the auspices of the West with some local support from the likes of his one-time friend late MKO Abiola.  With the assistance of my friend Prof. Duro Oni, who was a Ministerial Special Assistant, the bureaucracy worked, I received my Nigerian Airways ticket and I went on to New York, initially for a month on the basis of my appointment letter. But the main beneficiary on the budget head, General Olusegun Obasanjo reduced my stay to two weeks. Prof Gambari intervened stressing that he needed my assistance in New York. So, I started getting weekly extensions from General Obasanjo after phone calls from Ambassador Gambari to the General. This continued till the end of the race, about 8 weeks from my arrival date. We had several straw polls to reduce the 11 Africans in the race to a manageable number. The Nigerian Ambassadors who were in the General Assembly delegation of Nigeria showed little interest with the exception of Ambassador Ayo Azikiwe who constantly stayed by me as we waited by the Security Council for results of the polls. General Obasanjo decided not to withdraw and asked us to steadfastly stay till the end although it was clear that we would not make it. It is history that we worked very hard. Prof. Gambari remained loyal to his brief in spite of minimal support from home. The British and the French refused to accept Olusegun Obasanjo with one of them telling Prof. Gambari and myself that they want a Secretary and not a General. We lost the post to another African – Boutros Boutros-Ghali. At least Babangida could see it as a success since, as the President of the Organisation of African Unity at the time, Africa succeeded in getting an African even if the Arab world appropriated him the day after the elections as an Arab candidate. In addition, Babangida had cut his towering former boss who dared to want to zoom to the world stage to size. This assignment boosted my relationship with Prof. Gambari who started treating me like a younger brother. He was very religious and at the same time liberal and very tolerant of the foibles of people like myself who lacked the discipline of religious precepts. So, I had no reservation to write to him that I was going to a conference in South Carolina in late 1992 and asked if I could stop to see him in New York on my way back to Nigeria. I requested for accommodation assistance. It was at this meeting that Prof Gambari told me that the Secretary-General (Boutros-Ghali), had written to the Federal Government of Nigeria asking for the nomination of three Nigerians of which at least one should be a female to join the United Nations. He gave me the appropriate form for seeking a job with the UN and asked me to fill and return same to Abdullahi Omaki who was his Special Assistant. Abdullahi later became Nigeria’s Ambassador to Chad and Consul-General in Equatorial Guinea. Prof. Gambari informed me that he could not nominate anyone and must wait for nominations from home. However, he let me know that he was certain from experience that the Ministry of External Affairs would not respond by the deadline. He knew that the politics of whose brother/sister as well as the infamous federal character principle that tended to paralyze such decisions on who would be seconded and/or compete for political posts at the international level. He assured me that he would submit my application as one of three interested Nigerians after the deadline. He encouraged me that he was certain that I would do well at the recruitment interview. If the Ministry of External Affairs had done the nominations, there would have been no need for competitive interview. In effect, Prof. Gambari used his personal influence to ensure that I joined the several applicants from all over the World. I succeeded at the interview that was conducted by the UNDP Country Office in Lagos on behalf of the UN Secretariat. However, I was not amused when I was told that the job was in Somalia. At that time, furious fighting was going on in Somalia, where people were being killed on a regular basis. My first daughter as a young girl could hear about people being killed on CNN that was free at the time. She was sad and asked why I wanted to go and die. I responded that if I died, they would receive $250,000 death insurance and when they are spending it, they should remember that I died so that they may live. I arrived Mogadishu thinking I would only spend 6 months and return to my academic post and practice of law on the side to survive. While in Mogadishu, I met late McIver. I do not remember his first name. I think an English name as well as Kayode or so.  With his surname, one would have thought he was from Great Britain. But he was actually a Yoruba man from Kwara State of Nigeria. We became very good friends. He subsequently told me that he was the second person nominated by Professor Gambari. Till today, I do not know the third Nigerian who must have been a lady. As for my time at the UN, it was not a stay of 6 months as I initially convinced my wife, but one of 23 years 10 months. Lucky that I did not die in service but survived two bombs in Mogadishu and a kidnap attempt in Darfur during my UN career. I wish Ambassador Gambari all the very best in the challenges he will face. He has the experience to bring a lot on the table with respect to best practices from all over the world to arrest the cascading downward move of our dear nation. I recollect that he gave a balanced beautiful speech at Mai Zube farms last July when General Abdulsalami Abubakar invited him to chair the meeting on the way forward to achieve safety and security in Nigeria. He only needs to re-read that speech and be guided by some of the suggestions at that meeting, including those that did not make it into the communique. It is an almost impossible time to be a CoS. All eyes and many hopes are on him towards assisting the elected leadership to focus on the insecurity that we face aside from handling the transition from crisis into a necessary transition before talking of the post-Covid-19 challenges that our country will face.  The comments of those who have been unsatisfied with Prof. Gambari’s appointment should only ginger him to transparently deliver towards an improved Nigeria. I know he has handled similar post-conflict situations for the world at large. He can do it if he is allowed to assist in making a difference in his suave ways. He is, after all, a Chief of Staff and not the President that Nigerians elected. The buck stops on the table of President Muhammadu Buhari."
Elections,Rivers Women To Turn Up At INEC Office Naked — Unless Effanga Is Removed As REC,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/03/28/rivers-women-turn-inec-office-naked-%E2%80%94-unless-effanga-removed-rec,"Thousands of women have taken to the streets of Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, to demand the immediate redeployment of the Obo Effanga, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC). The protesters, dressed in black and drawn from the 23 local government areas of the state, said his continued stay in the state was breeding tension and possible breakdown of law and order. Carrying placards with various inscriptions, the women threatened that if in the next 48 hours, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), fails to heed to their demand, they would storm INEC's Port Harcourt head office naked.  Protests for and against the INEC REC have intensified in Rivers State in the last three days, with pro-government demonstrators asking that Effanga be retained in the state, whereas the anti-Effanga protesters want his removal, accusing him of compromising the outcome of the March 9 governorship and state house of assembly elections in the state to favour Nyesom Wike, incumbent Governor of Rivers State. The women are not alone in the call for the removal of Effanga, as some governorship candidates have joined the call. In a recent article he wrote and circulated, Tonye Cole, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), said only the redeployment of Effanga would guarantee conducive atmosphere for free and fair elections in Rivers State. He called for the outright cancellation of the polls, just as he re-echoed earlier calls by Dumo Lulu-Briggs, the Accord Party candidate, who had described the entire exercise as a ""charade"", and Victor Fingesi of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), who said INEC planned the polls to fail."
Opinion,SPECIAL REPORT: Why Troops Are Losing Ground To ISWAP,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/01/02/special-report-why-troops-are-losing-ground-iswap,"In the few days leading to the eclipse on 2018, reports from the warfront in North East Nigeria provoked huge concerns, fiercely stirring panic within communities in and around Maiduguri, Borno state. Governor Kashim Shettima, within this period, quickly called an emergency security meeting to receive briefs from different security commands in the state. At the Executive chambers of the Government House, Maiduguri, the seat of power in the state, the situation was grim and faces drawn.  In fact, the situation appeared so dire as Nigerian troops facing the onslaught of the combined affront of insurgency from terror groups, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram forces, beat a steady retreat, incurring monumental losses of locational facilities. Within two weeks, the Nigerian troops had retreated tactically or been overrun in strategic military bases. Out of 20 military bases in northern and central Borno where Nigerian troops were in control, 14 had been overrun or altogether shut down. Does the recent string of losses by the military represent a momentary setback likely to be overturned swiftly by the military or is the trend a fore-test of an uncertain future? All diplomatic and international military platforms knowledgeable about the escalating conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin affirm that at no time since the surge of violence in the region have the terrorists been in command of the level of weapons available to them today. Two developments explain this. The terror groups, in recent times, have received a flush of funds from ransom paid to them allegedly by the government. Equally, there has been a steady access to unimaginable cache of military weaponry, including hardware and ammunition from bases overran by the insurgents, remarkably bolstering their war chest. For instance, the loss of the International Military Task Force Base, headquarters of the Multinational Joint Task Force, in Baga, headed by an Army General, is reported as monumental, not merely in the loss, of location but because of the massive military hardware and ammunition only comparable to what is available to the Military Division in Maiduguri, to ISWAP.  The insurgents are obviously riding the momentum and are motivated in manners that are completely alien to the military. According to a recent report by the AFP, in no year since the upsurge of conflicts in the North East have Nigerian troops been exposed to the level of casualties inflicted on them by the insurgents in 2018 alone.  With an enlarged war chest, a strategic control of the economic mainstay of the Chad Basin cross cutting fishing, all season farming, water and control of cross border trade routes, the insurgents are looking formidable. No wonder, they have recently scaled up recruitment of new fighters across both English and French speaking countries in the surrounding countries of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. Information gleaned from contacts within the fold of ISWAP paint an insight that seems to have challenged the position of politicians and the military in respect of holding territory. ISWAP always considered the territories of Northern and Central Borno their Caliphate territories. The presence of the Nigerian troops and particularly military bases were considered invasion by the military. Bidding their time until they had adequate ammunition with additional army of motivated fighters to unleash new wave of violence the group was willing to stay under the radar for a few years before drawing the line on the sand. Their long wait paid off in 2018. They have been on the offensive all of 2018. The ISWAP’s strategy is to put everything available to ensure that military presence in those territories they consider part of their caliphate is made ever untenable. ISWAP considers all parts of north and central Borno as its caliphate and territory and therefore obligated by doctrines and commandment to repel every external aggression within the territory.  This is irrespective of whatever politicians and the military claim is the situation within those territories. In fact, Boko Haram / ISWAP policy with respect to physically holding territories changed after the steady losses they suffered in the run up to general elections in Nigeria in 2014. They do not want to physically hold unto territories anymore than they are determined to ensure that the military does not have any sustainable presence in the territories. Furthermore, ISWAP is paying more premium to wooing local communities to feel more secure with them than they could ever be with the military. That is their strategy. They have secured the economic lines in the territories they control. The Lake Chad territories have become more fertile for famers and more viable for commercial fishing activities. They have largely crippled the fish and onions markets in Maiduguri. In its stead, they have opened secured trading locations in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic and another in Kusiri, in Cameroon. Nigerian traders rely on the market in Kusiri, Cameroon through Mubi, in Adamawa. The other in Kinchandi, in Niger Republic. The Nigerian market in Hadeja, Jigawa state depend heavily on the market in Niger Republic.  Nigerian troops apparently would rather confiscate a trader’s wares, forcibly take their livestock for their feeding than device any system of commercial comfort that would help them grow their business. It therefore seems not far-fetched that several local communities appear to cooperate better with ISWAP than with the Nigerian troops. ISWAP want to primarily make it unattractive and too expensive in terms of body count and loss of hardware for the military to maintain a base in any of these territories. They calculate that as long as they continually target and attack military formations, forcing them to beat a retreat so long would it be easier for local communities to accept that they are more secure in the territories under them than under the cover of Nigerian troops. Moreover, they envisage that for as long as they sustain the push back against the military for so long will it be difficult for the demoralized troops to muster confidence to put them at tactical disadvantage anytime soon.  Is the 2018 military strategy and campaign working? The facts based on the number of military formations successfully attacked and overran by ISWAP in 2018 in the areas of its dominance is 70 percent. What this translates into is that out of 20 military bases in these territories, ISWAP have either sacked by overrunning or forced the military to shut down a total of 14 bases in 2018 alone. The only time this ratio of attacks and takeovers came close to the 2018 numbers was in 2014. By the end of 2015 it was below 50% success ratio, which further dropped in 2016 and 2017, only to witness a sharp surge in 2018.  The outlook of the map in the battle theatres is grim. The territories that constitute Northern Borno are 10 Local Government Areas lying north of Maiduguri and bearing natural land borders with three countries namely Niger Republic, Chad and Cameroon. ISWAP have full sway in these territories currently. The territories that constitute Borno Central are made up of eight Local Government Areas, and both ISWAP and Boko Haram have significant footholds in these territories. Southern Borno, made up of nine Local Government Areas, is the least affected, with the exception of flashpoints such as Gwoza, Damboa and Chibok. With barely 45 days to presidential election in Nigeria there seems to be more energy at official quarters to cover up the tragic situation than acknowledging it. The military have rightly stated that ISWAP may not be holding most of the territories where it overran its bases, especially the town of Baga. ISWAP, on its part, is also right when it says it has sacked soldiers from the areas it attacked, including Baga. Neither the military nor the insurgents have the manpower and capacity to hold and govern over these large expanse of land sustainably. But in desisting from building visible administrative and military structures in the areas of their primary interest ISWAP have evolved in a way that is difficult for Nigerian troops to track. On the other hand, by being fixated with claim of control of territories the military have only succeeded in making its troops sitting ducks and easy targets of the enemy. More clearly, ISWAP is no longer showing interest in taking a formidable military base such as was in Baga and staying put there. It doesn’t apparently serve their tactical and strategic interest well. They are more interested in taking over military hardware and ammunition in those bases while instilling fear on the troops and making it extremely difficult for the military to have the comfort to plan and launch attacks. For instance, two days after overrunning the military base in Baga, the ISWAP moved out of location with military hardware and ammunition. According to knowledgeable sources, the objective is not to necessarily capture and hold new territories, what is far more strategic to ISWAP is to continually “unsettle the military in their bases across the Lake Chad region.”  There is no better indication to the effectiveness of the tactical approach of ISWAP against the military than seeing that Nigerian troops in the troubled locations are unable to undertake patrol duties. Rather, they are mostly in the trenches practically waiting for the next attack. One troubling outcome of this is the escalating number of troops on desertion charge. For instance, in just one detention centre in Jos, Plateau state, there are over 20 military deserters rounded up and detained. Similarly, a growing army of deserters are being held across major military detention facilities in the country. Obviously embarrassed at this turn of events, the military authorities are zealously covering up on these.  An Army officer currently hospitalized lamented that “soldiers have become cannon fodders,” revealing:""There are more soldiers deserting their commission over Boko Haram war. I can count dozens in my unit alone that escaped after they survived an attack.” The Nigerian Police Force are embroiled in similar matter with 121 officers of the rank-and-file who reportedly deserted in protest against planned deployment to the warfront dismissed with immediate effect.  The Inspector-General Ibrahim Idris, according to a report in Premium Times (December 28, 2018), ordered their dismissal. “The Police are very kind to their officers for dismissing them, we are not that lucky because after we attempted to escape, we were arrested and detained without trial for several months,” said a soldier detained in one of Special Task Force (STF) detention centers in Jos. He was arrested after he absconded along with scores of his colleagues from the warfront.  A confident Army Captain in the frontlines who spoke with our reporter on condition of anonymity extolled the troops for their gallantry on several occasions. He said that unlike the terrorists, the military do not carry cameras into the battlefront to record gun exchanges. According to him there are far more attacks on military bases and units by the terrorists that were repelled than the ones in which the locations were overrun. “The terrorists go to battles with cameras, while we, as a matter of policy don’t.” Nevertheless, he contends that Nigerians do not care about the number of insurgents that we have killed, “the killing of soldiers that protect the country’s sovereignty constitute a source of concern, what this means is, if soldiers continue to die, Nigeria itself may fail to exist,” he concludes.  Some of these attacks were so overwhelming that the bases were overrun with hundreds of casualties. According to multiple media reports, not less than 1,000 soldiers were killed in 2018. These casualty figures do not include soldiers killed in Niger Republic, Yobe, Adamawa and in Southern Borno. “In fact, there has never been a year soldiers were killed more than in 2018; not even 2013 and 2014 did we see the kind of casualties we experienced today,” said another soldier who doubles as a medical doctor in Maiduguri. More traumatizing for soldiers, according to ISWAP sources, are the humiliating experience of scores of abducted soldiers compelled to tutor the insurgents on new weapons handling before they are enslaved or executed.  Informed sources state that the military facility in Monguno is probably the only larest operational base outside of Maiduguri presently that is unaffected. Four or five are in Gajiram, Gajiganna, Gubio, Kareto, while Damasak is manned by the Multi-National Joint Task Force at the border with Niger republic. According to a serving military officer currently hospitalized, “the soldiers in most of these bases have all taken up defensive positions to protect their turfs and can hardly venture outside to patrol or engage in any offensive attack”.  Just like the officers deserting, the Military itself has long abandoned any mentality of “no retreat, no surrender,’ having steadily been on the retreat from several military bases. Weeks ago, they shut down two bases in Gudumbali and Kukawa. “We retreated to Monguno before Baga was attacked. Now, some soldiers and residents are running away from Monguno to Maiduguri,” reported a soldier in Shagari Low Cost Housing Estate in Maiduguri. He highlights the utter helplessness of the soldiers: what is disturbing is the effrontery of “ISWAP in making sure that we are fully made aware of their plans ahead of any attack. There was never an attack that we don’t see in advance, yet we are helpless,” he lamented. In the midst of these setbacks, military fat cats are feeding exceedingly well on account of the war. On 28, December, 2018 the Defence and Foreign Affairs of the International Strategic Studies Association (ISSA) based in the United States stated that “the conduct of the war in the North (East of Nigeria) is tied to the corruption in the military, and (President) Buhari - ring-fenced by his own team - is unable to tackle the issue"". ISSA, the Washington-based non-governmental organization with a worldwide membership of professionals involved in national and international security and strategy, stated that massive corruption among top military chiefs appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari is the reason Nigeria is losing the war against Boko Haram. According to the report, the only significant engagement which the Nigerian military leadership seems determined to fight “is to stop the leakage of information about massive corruption, running into the equivalent of several billions of dollars, in the purchase by senior military officers of major military capital goods and military consumables, including the troops’ own food.” More than anything, it is the noticeable resurgence of the Lake Chad and the commercial viability of the territories under ISWAP that present the greatest pull on individuals in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps to return to their villages. But for others, it is their ability to put out a good fight and sometimes win with an Army that enjoys global support, that is the biggest inspiration that makes many want to join. A recent recruit and a Francophone citizen said, “ISWAP's fortunes only means one thing, Allah with us.” Another who abandoned his rich family business in Kano to become a fighter said, “I have no doubt Angels are fighting with us, otherwise there is nothing that explains our victories.”   In the light of these realities, should the Nigerian Military continue with the tactical mentality that is leading them into embarrassing losses? For a government that has made so much premium of a claim on its control of territory from the insurgents, what these developments point to is probably worse than a setback. Efforts by independent observers to point out the evidently skewed tactical mentality have been visited with official hostility. Local and international Civil Society Organizations and the media have, for these reasons, come under attack by the military. For calling the Military out on its ignoble human rights abuses, including rape and extra judicial executions, Amnesty International and other Human Rights organizations have been targeted for official harassment. Despite a consistent stream of global ratings and reports about Nigeria’s crisis, notable among them being the 2018 Global Terrorism Index in which Nigeria emerged the third most terrorized nation globally, both the Military and politicians in government have carried on as if this was of no consequence. The index placed Nigeria behind war-torn countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and ahead of Syria and Pakistan. However, the report also showed a 16% drop in the number of deaths linked to terrorism in 2017 from previous year.  Also, the World Economic Forum, in its biennial tourism report with the specific section focusing on safety and security, recently ranked Nigeria as one of the most dangerous countries in the world. Amid all these disturbing realities the local media generally have caved in to a new sense of self censorship promoted by the Nigerian military, which is, “stop reporting the killings to dissuade Boko Haram from further killings” instead of, prevent the insurgents from killings in the first place, so that, there wouldn’t be any death to report. "
Opinion,"Mystery, Controversy Over ABU Student's Suicide By Ibrahim Adeyemi","1 Year Ago
",/2019/01/02/mystery-controversy-over-abu-students-suicide-ibrahim-adeyemi,"
 
 Dead or alive? Repressed and depressed by parents or not? These are the controversial queries that filled the social media airwaves after the mysterious suicide action taken by Aisha Omolola, a 300 level student of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in her apartment at Samaru, Kaduna State.  Omolola was said to have committed suicide by drinking insecticide. She also reportedly dropped a note, stating why she took her life. According to the note, she wrote that her family should be held responsible for her suicide, especially her mother and father. She said the duo made life miserable for her and thus, killing herself was the only way she could save herself from the family's frustration. The letter reads below: When the news of the ABU student's suicide made headlines, most Nigerians condemned the act. However, there are still some questions surrounding her demise left unanswered. Few days after reactions followed Aisha's suicide action, it went viral on social media that she survived the attempt to commit suicide. The source of the rumour is traceable to the post on the Facebook page of Ahmadu Bello University, Samaru, Zaria. The post, which has more than a thousand shares and likes have made many Nigerians wonder whether she really survived her suicide mission. However, the picture attached to the Facebook post, showing Aisha in the hospital receiving treatment is the first fact that falsifies the rumours. This is because the said picture was posted on Twitter sometime in October 2018, when Aisha was said to have had an accident.  The rumour was further falsified by eye-witnesses who witnessed how Aisha died and was buried. Audu Abdulqudus, a recent graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and close friend to Aisha affirmed that he was among many others who were present at her funeral on the same day she committed suicide. ""I was the main friend that carried her dead body the very day she died at the Jamaa hospital in Samaru. I and her [best friend’s father], Mr AbdulGaniu with two policemen took her to the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital mortuary. ""I was called by Maryam Salami, Aisha's childhood friend on Thursday evening towards 4:00pm. So, it was Maryam that now told me about the mum telling her that they were at the mortuary and they wanted to go and bury her that very evening on Thursday. When contacted, Maryam Salami, a childhood friend of Aisha confirmed the death of her bosom friend, adding that Aisha’s death was mysterious. ""We don't know what to say. That's how God planned her own death; let's just put it that way,"" she said.  Also, one Ruth Omole who was at Samaru hospital where Aisha gave up the ghost affirmed that Aisha did not survive the incident. The note left by Aisha about the cause of her suicide has created lots of controversies; there seems some mysterious issues thematically in the note. The impression generally created in the letter was that Aisha's parents frustrated and repressed her so much that they made her ""not to believe in God anymore”, most especially her mother. As indicated in the note, Aisha frowned at how her mother so much rejected and dejected her while she was alive. According to the note, she (her mother) would blame her for everything and even called her a witch. Though all efforts to reach any of her parents proved abortive, the deceased’s childhood friend, Maryam Salami, first confirmed that Aisha was the original author of the letter. ""Aisha wrote that letter. That's her handwriting,"" she affirmed. She, however, added that the interpretation of the note could best be conveyed by its author. ""Half of what she said could be true and could not be true. It's a personal issue and we should leave it personal. In that letter, she said something that has to do with herself and her mother or people around her. We shouldn't interfere. That letter said a lot. I know what that letter means, but I don't want to say anything. That letter should just be left. That letter is nothing. People should just let bygone be bygone. We should just pray for her and God should forgive all of us,"" she said. Were religious differences ever a barrier between Aisha and her parents? Salami said religion could not have been the apple of discord. This is contrary to what has been widely spread on social media. It was said that Aisha had been victimised by her parents just because she converted from being a Christian to a Muslim. However, Salami, her friend said that could not be true, adding that Aisha was a person who was never religiously stable. She was a Christian today, Muslim tomorrow.   ""Aisha converting from a Christian to a Muslim is nothing. That has never or had never been the problem because right from primary school, Aisha has been one person that it's either she's a Muslim today or she's a Christian today,"" she said. ""She (Aisha's mother) has always loved her daughter and she feels she's old enough to know what she wants. Religion has nothing, I mean nothing, to do with this. Aishat's mother had nothing to do with Aishat converting from this to that. The mom has no problem with Aisha being a Muslim. Her mother has never interfered in it,"" she added. Really, the reason behind the deceased's suicide seems to be very mysterious. While the note portrays that she had no good relationship with her parents, especially her mother, her tweets proves contrary. On December 18, 2018, Aisha wrote on her Twitter page, praising and praying for her 'lovely mother’. ""Ya Allah, bless my mom...keep her for me, give me the strength, ability and ways to be a blessing to her. Let me be the reason behind her smile and happiness. Please give her long life to reap the fruit of her labour. I love you mom. My Woman My Everything,"" she tweeted. Also, on Tuesday December 25 of the same year, before Aisha committed suicide on Thursday, 27th of the same month and year, she posted on Twitter again, telling her friends how she would celebrate Christmas with her family even as a Muslim. ""Ah celebrate Christmas too cos my family is mixed! Let love lead,"" she tweeted. The question is: What could have happened between Aisha and her parents that could have warranted her to commit suicide within the aforementioned short period of time? Minus the suicide reportedly committed by Aisha, her friends described her as being friendly, nice and generous. As her childhood friend, Maryam also described Aisha as someone who was crazy but nice and friendly. ""She's crazy. She has her ups and downs just like any other person. I've loved her for who she is. No matter how much she annoys me, I'll still go there and still look for her. She's always there to listen to people but she doesn't share any of her feelings or anything that is going on within her,"" she added. Before her death, Aisha appeared to have enjoyed her stay on earth. On December 11, 2018, she tweeted: ""God I thank you for the gift of life. Thank you for giving me reasons never to give up on life."" Also, on October 1, 2018, after she survived an accident, she posted on Twitter, giving thanks to God for her survival and praying for long life. ""For a moment, I thought I was gonna die. In fact, I started saying my last prayers asking mom to pray for me too but ALHAMDULILLAH. I am a witness of Allah's mercy and by HIS Grace I shall live to see more healthy years,” she posted."

In his days of ""truth-telling’’ and before the hex of unclean spirits in Aso Rock, Adesina was the man from miyshore – the straight place.  He was loved. He cut the persona of a light bearer. But why has the ""kulikuli exponent’’ so unravelled? By the way, it was Reuben Abati, Adesina’s predecessor, who regaled us with the tale of paranormal activities at Aso Rock. Abati in ‘Rituals, blood and death: The spiritual side of Aso Rock’, said: ""When presidents make mistakes, they are probably victims of a force higher than what we can imagine. Every student of Aso Villa politics would readily admit that when people get in there, they actually become something else. They act like they are under a spell.’’ So, I am compelled to believe that Adesina may be under a spell -- for his uncharacteristic deportment. Really, he takes a nose-dive deeper and deeper into crassitude, insouciance, arrogance and iniquity. I wrote the draft of this article earlier than today but had it pigeonholed. I was conflicted – do I or do I not? Will my opinion be mistaken? Well, I have to blurt it out anyway. 
 
 I knew the rulers of darkness and the principalities and powers in high places, like those sketched by Nathan Uzoma, the ‘’ghost buster’’, were at work when Adesina, a devout Christian, implied that giving land to marauding herdsmen was better than getting killed. Responding to a question on ancestral attachments to land on an AIT programme in July 2018, Adesina said:  “Ancestral attachment? You can only have ancestral attachment when you are alive. If you are talking about ancestral attachment, if you are dead, how does the attachment matter?’’ Also, Adesina does not spare his tongue in thrashing the Christian Association of Nigeria at every given turn. In fact, he is always on an ambush waiting for CAN to speak so he could attack. It appears he enjoys the sadomasochism on the Christian association. He once described CAN as a political party. When the Christian association was protesting over the death of Lawan Andimi, the pastor beheaded by Boko Haram, Adesina intervened with a caustic aspect, censuring the association for expressing indignation over their loss. But this is not to obviate CAN’s occasional alarmist tendency Adesina has sunk steeply into the abyss of conceit. He has thrown caution to the wind and allowed himself to be swayed by the vortex of terminal privilege.  The Yoruba say:  T'á bá rán eni ní isé erú, à fí t'omo je. Translation: ‘’If you are sent on an errand as a slave, deploy the wisdom of a free born in delivering the message.’’ Adesina continues to deal a whammy to those who once admired him – including me.  In an interview on Nigeria Info FM on May 6, the presidential spokesman dealt another shocker. He said: “People think because either you elected a president or you didn’t elect him, you must lead your president by the nose. It doesn’t happen. Because you elected a man then you begin to order him around.” I know Adesina understands the concept of democratic leadership. I know he is well aware that the president is an employee of Nigerians, and as such he is answerable to them and should even be ordered around by them. Yes, I know Adesina knows Nigerians are the boss of his boss, and that he must do as they please. I know he knows this. Perhaps, the extramundane forces of Aso Rock are at work again. Adesina’s bewitchment ossified, when he tried to rope former President Olusegun Obasanjo into his hexed web. He said Obasanjo would have insulted those asking him to address the nation. How farcical. So, Obasanjo is now a standard for gauging President Buhari’s tepidity and lethargy?   I know it is difficult to speak for an administration that has failed in every sphere. But what is expected in this case is applying tact, temperance and wisdom in defending a failed experiment. Insulting Nigerians and anyone who criticises the president is an ignoble exertion by a man who was once the president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors. The presidential spokesman should learn a lesson or two from his predecessors. Power is only temporary. It will be difficult if not impossible to regain lost integrity and trust. Some former presidential spokesmen lost their shine after they joined government and became the archetype of what they onced criticised. They lost relevance soon after they left office. Really, after he leaves Aso Rock, would I like to read Femi Adesina again? I do not think so."
Opinion,Mubarak Bala: Why They Hate Him By Leo Igwe,"23 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/16/mubarak-bala-why-they-hate-him-leo-igwe,"For allegedly making posts and comments on his Facebook page which some Muslims interpreted as insults on the prophet of Islam, police in Nigeria arrested Mubarak Bala. They have detained and held him incommunicado for almost three weeks. The Islamic establishment has refused to speak out against this illegality and infringement on his fundamental human rights. In fact, some Muslims have threatened to kill Mr. Bala if he was not adequately punished by the ‘state’. It is important to ask, why do they hate Mubarak Bala? Why is there so much dislike for a little known individual who made innocuous posts on his Facebook page? By ‘they’ here I mean those who wrote the petition against Mr. Bala including all muslims who are directly or indirectly calling for him to be dealt with? Why has Mr. Bala become such as bête noire, someone that is so despised in the local Muslim community? Here are the reasons. But before explaining them, I would like to provide some background to my relationship with Mr. Bala. I never knew Mubarak Bala before 2014. I never heard about the name. We connected through some strange circumstance. In 2014, I was studying for my doctorate in Germany. One day I got a message that an ex Muslim had been taken to a mental hospital. I was both worried and confused. All the ex-muslims that I knew then were in the closet. I was asked to join efforts to release him from the hospital. Bala’s family took him to this health facility after he went open and public with his disbelief and criticism of Islamic religion. The family thought he was out of his mind. For days, I struggled to understand what was going on. Religion, especially Islam is a charged issue in Northern Nigeria. I wondered how I could effectively intervene in this case while living thousands of miles away. 
 
 I was under immense local and international pressure to rally support because time was of essence. Bala was being treated for mental illness that he did not have. Those who contacted me were in Lagos which was very far from Kano where Mubarak Bala was. They also relied on information from third parties. I managed to call the psychiatric hospital in Kano. And they confirmed that Mubarak was a patient and had been admitted to the facility. But they refused to provide details of his case. After some back and forth calls and emails, I managed to piece together what could be going on and joined the campaign. I issued a statement calling for Mr. Bala's  release. We hired a lawyer to help with his case. Incidentally, as we were trying to figure out how to get him out from the hospital, the staff embarked on industrial action and Mr. Bala left the hospital. He became a free man. Since then, Mr. Bala has been very outspoken in his criticism of Islamic extremism. He has been the face of atheism and freethought in Northern Nigeria. His experience has inspired many atheists and ex-Muslims in northern Nigeria to go open and public with their views and positions. Bala has become synonymous with apostasy and blasphemy in the Islamic Northern Nigeria. So they hate Mr. Bala because he renounced Islam. They believe that Islam is a perfect religion that people can embrace but not abandon. Bala was born into a Muslim family and they had expected him to remain a Muslim for the rest of his life. However, Bala disappointed them. He did not live up to their expectations. He left Islam. Bala did not even convert to Christianity, which would have been bad enough but not as bad. He became an atheist, a 'bloody infidel'. Mr. Bala betrayed them. And they are angry and furious with him. Now they are trying to punish him for the betrayal. Apostasy is a crime under sharia law and in Islam. As an apostate, Mubarak Bala is, for them, a criminal who deserves to be punished as required by Islamic law. Bala should be forced to recant and return to the Islamic fold or be removed from the Islamic community via imprisonment or execution. This has not happened. Mr. Bala has not received any punishment, or better an adequate penalty (I was told that his family had disowned him). To them, Mr. Bala has not been given a penalty that is severe enough to make him regret leaving Islam. Instead, Bala has made it seem acceptable to leave Islam. He has been living his normal life and freely going about his everyday business. And this has not gone down well with them. Mr. Bala has made it look as if one can abandon Islam and still live happily and freely, not hiding or living in fear for one's life in Islamic Northern Nigeria. In fact, Mr. Bala has gone to the extent of openly declaring to contest for a political office in Kano. Now if they had some residual love for Mubarak Bala given his family and ethnic ties to the region, that affection has disappeared. Mr. Bala has caused them to hate him more by openly criticizing Islam. As an apostate, they expected Bala to keep quiet and not to say anything about Islam and the prophet. By renouncing Islam, Bala had lost the authority to speak freely about the religion. For them, only Muslims can talk about Islam. It is only believers or those who have something apologetic, complementary, and supportive to say about Islam and the prophet that can talk or openly comment on this perfect religion and its perfect messenger.  For them, critical views about Islam and the prophet are not allowed even if these viewpoints are true and based on facts. Critical views about Islam and the prophet are blasphemes. And blasphemy is a crime, another crime that is punishable by death under sharia law. Blasphemy law is a weapon to silence and eliminate critics of Islam and perpetuate the teachings of this religion whether they are true or false. It is a mechanism to stop people from making unauthorized comments about Islam. Blasphemy law is what the Islamic establishment use to police and censor what people say and express about Islam and the prophet. So they hate Mr. Bala because he criticizes Islam and freely speaks about the prophet of Islam. He is a progressive mind and a champion of islamic reformation and social change. Mr. Bala draws attention to aspects of Islam and the prophet's life which are often hidden and forbidden. He points out those teachings of Islam and the prophet which he finds mistaken and incompatible with human rights, science, and critical thinking. He calls attention to those Islamic practices that he finds morally repugnant and objectionable. They hate Mr. Bala because he is not afraid to speak his mind. Simply put, they hate Bala because he is an apostate and a 'blasphemer'. In addition, they hate Mubarak Bala because he has emboldened many atheists in muslim dominated communities in Northern Nigeria. Many atheists in Northern Nigeria are leaving their closet and becoming assertive of their views and identities. Bala has inspired many young people in Northern Nigeria to begin to freely express their disbelief in Islam. They dislike him because he has become a formidable moral and intellectual force behind the growing wave of atheism in Islamic Northern Nigeria."

Opinion,Gov. Wike And Nigeria’s Culture Of Waste By Osmund Agbo,"23 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/16/gov-wike-and-nigeria%E2%80%99s-culture-waste-osmund-agbo,"As a PDP Governor in Rotimi Amechi’s River state, I had since concluded that Nyesom Wike’s heart was carved out of raw steel. When he squared off with the no holds barred APC thugs during his 2018 re-election campaign, many predicted his fate would not be different from that of former Governor Ayo Fayose of Ekiti State. In the end, he proved himself to be the biblical David whose one sling-shot was all it took to demolish the mighty Goliath. He came out a battle-hardened and typhoon-blasted warrior. Since then, this Rumuepirikom born lawyer had fought more battles than the most decorated general in the Nigeria Army. The average Nigerian politician inspires the image of a dare-devil warrior in a primitive cannibal tribe. He hacks the enemy to death, harvests the organs which he morsels down fast with blood dripping down from both sides of his mouth. He then moves on quickly to throws the carcass to the dogs to put paid any possibility of a come-back, all in a hedonistic final act of savagery. 
 
 Part of the reason for Wike’s victories had to do with the tremendous goodwill he enjoyed from both far and near. He became the poster child of the resistance movement against an overbearing APC government that promised brute force and was hell bent on having Dr. Dakuku Peterside installed at all cost. How can you blame a man whose enemy defies every single rule of decent engagement? But that was back then. Our once likeable Governor has now caught the power bug, pushing his luck as far as it could go and starting to behave like the very people he spent his life fighting. He is beginning to wield unbriddled power, exhibiting a cowardly act of mindless thuggery and in fact becoming totally unhinged. The other time he detained the pilot and co-pilot working for Caverton, a servicing company that provide logistic support services to NNPC, Shell and others. He stated that they landed in River State without clearance even though the flight was already approved by the Minister of Aviation. Yesterday, he took the barbarism a notch higher. He personally oversaw the demolition of two hotels, over an alleged breach of lockdown rules intended to contain the spread of Covid-19. The managers of both businesses were also reportedly arrrested. Now, as callous as those actions are, I wound concede that one is not privy to the facts on the culpability of those involved. But that’s besides my issue with the whole situation. It’s about a people, our people and the culture of waste and abuse. As my friend once argued, it was the man that committed the crime, why should our society loose something of such a great economic value in the process. Who stands to gain from such a monumental waste of resources?  If the Governor’s argument is that the public stands to suffer from the intrasigence of these men, then it makes sense that the remedial action should benefit the public. Instead, a state where a great number of young men are condemned to a life of militancy because of harsh economic realities would now have to grapple with the bill incurred in bringing down fully built structures. But this is not just about Gov. Wike and his theatrics in River states. Numerous instances of such executive overreach abound. There were similar reports involving his counterparts in both Kaduna and Edo states where solid edifices were knocked down in the name of retribution. Such a pervasive culture of waste in a country where more than half the population can’t afford three square meals a day is unconscionable. At the height of Covid-19 lock down, it was so commonplace to see policemen and soldiers raid supermarkets and destroy everything within sight including bottles of drink and fresh groceries. Why should such be the case? How about issue the defaulter a ticket and ask to pay a hefty fine that will enrich the public purse? Our perverted sense of justice in Nigeria need not be as horrible as the way we administer it. Our mumu don do!"
Opinion,The Conversations On Agboola Gambari By Festus Adedayo,"21 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/16/conversations-agboola-gambari-festus-adedayo,"LIf credentials and academic certificates/laurels approximated excellence, by now, applauses to President Muhammadu Buhari for his choice of Ibrahim Agboola Gambari as successor to the late Abba Kyari as his Chief of Staff should be reaching their crescendo. Rather, the high-caliber diplomat and academic, who studied in respected universities of the world, has literally been suffocating under torrents of heavy lacerations he receives from invectives heaped on him since the appointment. Kudos must be given to Buhari however for, for the first time since he got the reins of governance five years ago, deploying the stratagems of a military officer. He sent analysts on a wild goose chase speculating as to where the successor to Kyari would come from. By the time Gambari sneaked into public consciousness, the news befuddled all, sending governmental star-gazers into a predictable frenzy.  Very few people in public space possess Gambari’s credentials. Kwara State’s Ilorin being where his umbilical-cord was buried, he holds a first degree from the London School of Economics, with specialization in International Relations and thereafter obtained a Masters and Doctoral degrees in Political Science/International Relations from Columbia University, New York. He began his international diplomacy, government and academic careers thereafter. He was Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid (1990) and got appointed as Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the United Nations, while his working orbit spanned the United Nations where he held forte as first Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser to the Secretary-General in Africa, Resident Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Head of the United Nations Mission to Angola and head of the UN Department of Political Affairs between 2005 and 2007. He had earlier served as Minister for External Affairs between1984 and1985.
 
 The above credentials should ordinarily gladden the hearts of Nigerians at a time like this when Buhari had consistently got the back of the tongues of the people for populating his government with barely capable personalities. Excited about the appointment, the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, who must have supposed that with Gambari, Nigeria was tottering out of its oft flounders, congratulated Nigeria and Gambari for this appointment. Laing had written on her Twitter page: “Delighted to hear that @MBuhari has appointed  (italics mine), Ibrahim Gambari as his new CoS.” If reactions by the ordinary man on the street to this appointment was anything to go by, a man who was apprised of the pedigree of Gambari, the unmistakable impression you would escape with was that Buhari had just appointed into office one of the most notorious Nigerian villains. Why is this so? Before going into the intricacies of this submission, it seems to me that it is either the villainy of the government Gambari had just been appointed into had reached such a notorious cusp that he could not but appropriate of it or that Gambari possessed notoriety  and which his appointment had forced Nigerians to bring out of the scabbard. The appointment had barely been minted out of the Aso Villa when the irrepressible Omoyele Sowore tore it into pieces. For South West Nigeria which the   subject that could lure it into delirium was to remind it of the June 12 miss of “El-Dorado” in MKO Abiola, Sowore opened a festering sore that had refused to heal 27 years after. The  , so said Sowore, was one of the plotters of that criminal coup against democracy and the people. Hear him: Gambari, “who some people claim is an intelligent man, used his ‘intelligence’ to defend the draconian policies of the Abacha regime while he was Nigeria’s Permanent Representative at the United Nations. He was one of Abacha’s equivalents of the “Goebel,” representing the infamous dictator with vigor and a propensity that could only be found in fascist Italy of old. He was once quoted as saying, ‘Nigerians don’t need democracy because democracy is not food. It is not their priority now.’ As more pressure mounted on the Abacha regime from all corners of the world, Professor Gambari became more notorious and ruthless in defending and deflecting attacks against the Abacha dictatorship.” Like one whose wound had just been stomped upon, Sowore got, especially Southern Nigeria, into a frenzy. Those who didn’t know who the commissars of that calamitous political moment in Nigeria were, were reminded of Gambari’s ignoble role. Then came Ambassador Dapo Fafowora. Excerpting from his book,  , Fafowora added to the credential of an enabler of despotism which Sowore tagged Gambari with. He literally labeled him a Judas who specialized in treachery and hewing down trees he climbed to the top. He concluded by saying that, “the result of (these) capricious and vengeful retirements that took place under the watch of Gambari is that the fine Foreign Service we had, of which we were all proud, was wantonly destroyed. Gambari played a leading role in this ugly episode. I don't expect anything better from him as CoS.” So many others have related unpleasant experiences under Gambari’s watch. Before now, he was said to have been a prominent member of the Buhari cabal who determined the temperature of governance in the last five years. Aware of the dissembling voices of a mob targeting to cut down an offending tree, I really do not want to make a foray into Gambari’s governmental pedigree which has been painted as a let-down. It is however bemusing that the same Gambari who is perceived as undesirable, was same man after the heart of the international community. To imagine that an international community which denounces tyranny of the Abacha hue, is same community that has consistently given Gambari spots to flower from one season to another, taking him on diplomatic shuttles around the world on international appointments, looks like an equivocation. While speaking with the press in his maiden interview at the Villa, Gambari was quoted to have said that his loyalty was to Buhari and not to the public. Which is the creed of that office. If Buhari succeeds in bonding with the people, Gambari may end up being a doyen of the people. Depending on how he is able to gauge the mood of his principal and swim along its currents, Gambari may be a success in office. However, no one needs to use a spiritual telescope to submit that he would be a huge failure in office. This is because, the pedigree of an infernal but abiding allegiance to a caucus creed and the Fulani ethnic question that are said to be the prevailing bother of his governmental sojourn will surely haunt him. As he was said to have done while Abacha held sway, Gambari will again articulate the cronyism of the Buhari government, in the bid to “be loyal to my principal.” He will see no wrong in its timid or nil attempt to fight the scourge of poverty that grips the throat of the country and will undoubtedly give official imprimatur to government’s laid-back disposition to changing the status-quo. By 2023, God-willing, Agboola Gambari will go home a successful chief of the staff of Buhari, preparatory to going on another junket of assignments for the international community. He would however have elasticized his credentials as the   who gives soft landing to governments seen as haters of the people.   One good thing about the raging pestilence called COVID-19 is the way it has been breaking down the boundaries of orthodoxy. Long-held beliefs, assumptions and seemingly impregnable opinions are falling like badly-stacked cards. While religious orthodoxies, which some charlatans masquerading as pastors and Imams fed fat on for centuries are giving way, the world will never be the same again after the coronavirus’ wings are eventually clipped. One of the fatalities of COVID-19 is undoubtedly the almajiri institution, a system that is as old as Northern Nigeria. For decades, southerners who couldn’t fathom why a person would give birth to a child and throw him into the dangerous world, wandering aimlessly and without parental care, criticized this system as evil and satanic. This got the ire of the North which took the criticism as an extension of the so-called southern disaffection for anything that has North prefixed to it. The almajiri system festered in its evil, gradually morphing into a ready tool for insurgents. From the rank of mature graduates of the almajiri system, who were weaned on the philosophy of the hostility of the world against them, insurgents got willing converts. Even at that, the deplorable class system of the North which encourages stratification, with the upper class feeding on the ignorance of the lower stratum and their ceaseless salute of rankadede for them, was not discouraged by the Northern elite. They needed the talakawa, prominent cadre of which is the almajiri, to continue to flourish. Now, the lives of the Northern elite are threatened. They have seen that the almajiri are easy conduits of the transmission of the coronavirus to the comforts of their own homes and palaces. In the herd movements of the almajiri lie an easy multiplication of the virus. Faced with this threat, the elite, in their survival instinct, now descended on the system, seeking to wipe it off. As Chinua Achebe wrote in his Things fall apart, agadi nwanyin, the  old woman gets uneasy when dried bones are mentioned in a proverb. The presence of the almajirisignifies death for the elite and their bid to continue to live forever. Pronto, they got leading elements of their class – the governors – to decree death on the system. States which had hitherto used the almajiri – mostly under-aged – to populate the ballot box and to inflate census figure, in order to survive, outlawed the system and there is today a frantic scamper to rout it. What they don’t know is that soon, there will be a renewed rebellion of the almajiri. Having seen how disposable they are to politicians and the Northern establishment that had pampered them with left-over foods while the children of the patrons of the systems schooled in Harvard, almajiri are likely to rebel against the system. Unfortunately, when the almajiri does his, as Yoruba musician, Ayinla Omowura, once sang, even those who did not negotiate to buy this lethal commodity would forcefully pay the price. That will be the lot of those who warned the Northern elite of the infernal nature of this system and Nigeria as a whole which will ultimately be the recipient of the revolt of the almajiri. Nothing depicts Jamaican reggae music superstar, Jimmy Cliff’s evergreen track, House of Exile more than two events that happened in the past week. Cliff had begun the track by stating that there is a day of feasting, day of gladness and day of sadness. One could eat in the day of feasting but will naturally be downcast on the day of sadness, said Cliff who said that these were features of a house of exile. This song depicts the binary nature of creation: two lips, two eyes, two legs, two kidneys and many others. So also is joy and sadness. That binary nature of life was what gripped friends, acquaintances and families of two Nigerians – the large-hearted and large-statured journalism icon, Dele Momodu and the late Kehinde Ayoola, ex-Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, who was, prior to his untimely demise, the Commissioner for Environment in the state. Let me begin from the latter. On Thursday last week, fear of the perishable nature of man and the fitting description of existence by the holy writ as vapour which burns for a short while and disappears without trace, gripped friends, family and acquaintances of Ayoola. It was at the news of his death. The 55-year old Ayoola was my friend and was generally liked by all and sundry. If elegies for the dead could raise them, Ayoola would be home now devouring a plate of amala. His memories were garlanded by those who saw him as a good example of how a public official should be. Ayoola and I started our friendship even while we belonged to different persuasions. He was of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and I, publicist of an All Progressives Congress (APC) governor. We both received and honoured an invitation to appear on an Ibadan television to defend our turfs. We literally spat in each other’s eyes, banging the table and aping the mythical Sango’s fire of fury. After the “war,” we exchanged smiles and cell phone numbers. Not long after this, a friend on Facebook alleged that I wanted to kill him and Ayoola was one who came to my rescue. “If it is defending where he belongs with words, Adedayo is a killer but if it comes to taking the life of a person, it is a no, no!” I paraphrase Ayoola’s intervention. Thereafter, we became friends, aligned on same persuasion in the build-up to the last gubernatorial election in the state. So you can imagine how downcast I was when his passage was made public. On the flip side of that monumental sadness stood Momodu, known as Bob Dee, a journalism exemplar whose strides I began to mop up back in the days at the university. Providence was to make some of his besotting friends like Oba Adedokun Abolarin and Prof Wale Adebanwi my friends too. As he celebrated his 60th last week, Bob Dee must be celebrating a media remarkability that has become synonymous with him. You may disagree with his views but you cannot put down his immense contributions to the Nigerian journalism creed in a very significant way. These are contributions etched on the rock which make him a name that can never be forgotten in the annals of our history. Momodu was one of those who took a mix of hard and soft issues journalism to the zenith in the 1990s via Weekend Concord and Classique and who held forte in the two dispositions. You can thus understand my binary feelings at the two occurrences. Ayoola was a great man, in the definition of greats. Highly cerebral, humble and one sired in the true tenets of African virtues and values, he will be sorely missed, not as an engaging cliché that dots dirges but in deed.  While I bid my friend, Ayoola goodnight till the resurrection morning, I salute Bob Dee on his 60thbirthday."
Breaking News,BREAKING: PDP's Fintiri Unseats Incumbent APC Governor Bindow In Adamawa,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/03/28/breaking-pdps-fintiri-unseats-incumbent-apc-governor-bindow-adamawa,"Ahmed Umar Fintiri, candidate of the peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has won the Adamawa State governorship election. To emerge victor, FIntiri polled a total of 376,552 votes to beat Jibrilla Bindow, incumbent Governor and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who secured 336,386 votes, amounting to a margin of 40,166. Before Thursday's supplementary election, Fintiri had polled 367,471 votes while Bindow had 334,995, leaving a margin of 32,476 votes and placing him in a quite comfortable situation, as only 40,988 votes were cancelled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Bindow might have harboured faint hopes of catching up with his adversary, but it was Fintiri who went even better, further widening the gap after polling 9,081 votes at the supplementary exercise to Bidow's 1,391. Governor-elect Fintiri is a former Adamawa State Governor whose reign remains one of the most short-lived ever in Nigeria's history. He was Speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly in July 2014 when Murtala Nyako was impeached as Governor. With his deputy, Bala Ngilari, having supposedly resigned just before the impeachment, Fintiri became Acting Governor for the three months within which the law mandated the conduct of a by-election. He was the favourite to win the resultant by-election. However, three days before the election, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja invalidated Ngilari's supposed resignation, saying it didn't follow the appropriate channel as it wasn't Nyako who accepted it. Consequently, it forbade the conduct of the election and ordered the swearing in of Ngilari as Governor.   In a twist of fate, when Fintiri secured the PDP ticket in last year's primary, he polled 1,656 votes to beat Abubakar Waziri, former Chief Protocol Officer to former president Goodluck Jonathan, who polled 465 votes, as well as Ngilari, who could only muster 76 votes."
,For Whom The Gates Open Wide By Wole Soyinka,,http://saharareporters.com/2020/03/12/whom-gates-open-wide-wole-soyinka,"
 
 These are depressing times – stemming from different factors of course – for a large sector of the nation. Insecurity, economy in a coma, a leadership in name only, having vanished into either, permanently AWOL in a time of serial crisis. No wonder mimic and debased forms of leadership assertiveness rush in to fill the vacuum!  The latest in the stakes of such power appropriation makes one can wonder which is the more reactionary order: the so-called feudal institution, or the self-vaunting modernized governance whose apex can bring the feudal to heel quite arbitrarily, without check and without seeming consequence. To rub pepper in the wound, the protagonist of that “progressive” order enjoys near-absolute immunity, thus, even when it has disgraced its status and violated its oath of office, caught literally with its pants down in open defecation, it can still pretend to act in the interest of progress, modernity and public well being.  Such are the ironies raised by the purported dethronement of the Emir of Kano, Mohammed Sanusi, with one stroke of a pen!     I was participant, albeit on the sidelines, when a similar scenario began to unfold in my own state, Ogun some years ago. The then governor, on account of an imagined slight by one of the monarchs in his domain was actually poised – not virtually but physically – poised to sign the dethronement and banishment order on that traditional ruler. His office was invaded by some of the panicked chiefs and stalwarts of Ogun state who rushed to ward off the impending order. One of them stopped at my home after the pacification session to narrate what had transpired, and how some of them had actually gone on their knees to plead with that governor to stay action. I was furious. I knew every detail of that affair, had listened to a recording of the speech that was supposed to have given this mighty offence. It was pure piffle!  “Why did you people plead with him? Don’t you realize you were making him feel a god? You should have let him carry on, then we would see what a cataclysm he had launched on the state!”     The man, an independent businessman of absolute integrity, and one of that governor’s intimate circle, smiled and said, “No, we couldn’t do that. We are his friends. We were pleading with him to save him from himself.”      What a pity Ganduje lacked friends who could have saved him from himself!  Insofar as one can acknowledge certain valued elements in traditional institutions, the man he thinks he has humiliated has demonstrated that he is one of the greatest reformers even of the feudal order. That is beyond question, a position publicly manifested in both act and pronouncements.  By contrast, Ganduje’s conduct, apart from the innate travesty of justice in this recent move, is on a par with the repudiated colonial order, one that out-feudalized feudalism itself, and is synonymous with authoritarianism of the crudest temper. The record shows, in this particular instance, that it is one that embodies modernized cronyism and alienated pomp and power – never mind the cosmetic gestures such as almajiri  reformation. It has proved one of the worst examples of a system that enables even the least deserving to exercise arbitrary, unmerited authority that beggars even the despotism of the most feudalistic traditional arrangements.      Emir Sanusi was a one-man EFCC sanitizations squad in the banking system taking on the powerful corrupters of that institution.  Unblinking, he trod on the interests of powerful beneficiaries of a worm-infested sector and, in the process, created permanent enemies. By contrast, confidence in immunity has catapulted his tormentor to the ranks of the most notorious public faces of the disorder that Sanusi strove to eradicate. Obviously, vengeance lay in wait, and he was not unaware of it. The signs were omnipresent and Sanusi acknowledged their imminence. I know this for a fact. Apart from exchanges some mutual associates – we held, not so long ago, a phone conversation during his visit to London, just after the shrinking of his domain signaled the commencement of a systematic attrition of his status.  I assured him I would shortly fulfill my long-standing promise to pay him a visit. He sounded very much aware of the impending fall of the axe of vengefulness and power primitivism. I can testify that he remained totally unfazed.      Most important of all, and most pertinently for the nation, Sanusi was one of the early warning voices against religious extremism whose bitter fruits the nation is currently reaping. Those who wish to understand how deeply he had anticipated and explored the potential consequences of this menace should refer to his novelette: The Adulteress’ Diary, a work that exposes and satirizes the hypocrisy of fundamentalist Islamic clericalism from the inside, that is, from the authoritative point of view of an Islamic scholar. This work did not endear him to hard core fundamentalist purveyors of social division, but even those opponents would have been wise to pay heed to his exposition, and its implicit warning.  Then perhaps even if Boko Haram still remained inevitable, the nation would have been much better prepared for its onslaught, and those of allied malignancies like ISWAP.     Why, I am not certain, but I do have the feeling that the palace gates of the Kano emirate are not yet definitively slammed against this Islamic scholar, royal scion and seasoned economist. It is just a feeling. Closed and bared, or merely shut however, the doors of enlightened society remain wide open to Muhammad Sanusi. As for his current crowing Nemesis, a different kind of gates remain yawning to receive him when, as must, the days of governorship immunity finally come to an end. Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad. The list is long, there are comrades in impunity  awaiting their day of reckoning. The files remain open, and the nation remains on the watch. The wheels of justice grind slowly, but sooner or later, they arrive.  "
,#FreeSowore: Chaining A Body Whose Mind Is Free By Modiu Olaguro,,http://saharareporters.com/2019/08/04/freesowore-chaining-body-whose-mind-free-modiu-olaguro,"
 
 “The young generation of whites, blacks, browns, whatever else there is, you’re living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there’s got to be a change, people in power have misused it, and now there has to be a change. And a better world has to be built and the only way it’s going to be built is with extreme methods. And I, for one, will join in with anyone—don’t care what colour you are—as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.”—Malcolm X at the Oxford Union in December, 1964. A couple of weeks after the 2019 presidential elections, I met Omoyele Sowore at the Sahara Reporters’ Civic Media Lab and after we exchanged pleasantries in his usual ""hey professor"" way, he told me in a sombre tone how travelling across Nigeria during his one year intensive campaigns had made him (upon his brief return to the United States) value things he had hitherto taken for granted having been practically away for twenty years. Sowore told me how he came to appreciate the leaders of America for the good roads, stable power, modern schools, world-class health care, mortgage facilities, welfare programs, etcetera. I listened to him with rapt attention and pity as he held the stand of the red water tank inside the compound. When he was done talking, I said the following words: ""Sir, please leave us here with our poverty and return to the states."" Unknown to many, Sowore is rich and comfortable. His children neither live nor school here. If I had a twelfth of the opportunity Sowore has, I would have forgotten the location of Nigeria on the world map. I am writing this as clear as I can with a heavy heart. Nigerians who are most hit by poverty and hunger have shown the most love to those inflicting those indignities on them. Although, a friend of his warned that he could dislike me for asking that he leave Nigerians with their poverty, I had to say it nonetheless. I do not know what could motivate someone as comfortable as ‘Sho’ to leave his family, job and convenience to fight against base conditions that ordinarily have little effect on him. Nigeria is a space of dead people. It is a dangerous black hole where no amount of good manifests as a result of its nature of neutralizing anything worthwhile thrown at it. The same people castigating Sowore are dying in hunger, writhing in pain and smiling in agony; yet clutch in vain hope, struggling to take a seat on the podium where praises are heaped on the custodians of their chains. How will a country led by established thieves, certificate forgers and freeloaders appreciate a person like Sowore who created something out of nothing? How did Nigeria treat Professors Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Pius Adesanmi and Ayodele Awojobi? Did Awojobi, a genius professor of engineering not threaten to go study law? Did the Nigerian government not frustrate him that he once broke down in tears in court? If I had an herbalist, I will not think twice before taking Sowore's name there and cause him to forget the name of his country. For thirty years since he found his voice, Nigeria has chained, arrested and molested him. Until two years ago when he overcame the fear of death, he used to sneak in and out of the country. As it stands, the day I leave this country will be the last I will complain about it. The argument that there is no place like home holds water when there is one to begin with. How has Nigeria been made home for Nigerians? Did the president not say the southeast was not a part of his constituency? Daily, we live in fear. Fear of insecurity. Fear of devaluation of a weak currency. Fear of war. Fear of an increase in the pump-price of petrol. Fear of a social uprising. Fear of everything. Anyone resident here with no fear in his/her heart is either dead or delusional. The reality is that this country will not get better anytime soon—not with the ruinous path her wicked handlers have intentionally put her. The thought that the rest of the world left us in the 17th century to move to the 21st is enough to prove my point. Look around you: from the roads politicians build to the rail, from agriculture to education, and from our hospitals back to our governance system, can you spot a difference between them and those that have been around since the time of Isaac Newton?  Unlike many, Omoyele Sowore is a firm believer in Nigeria and Nigerians. In July when he met with Nnamdi Kanu, one of the things he told him was his aversion to the snide remarks members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) make against members of other ethnic stock in Nigeria. Sowore told him everyone outside of the political class is suffering a form of injustice or the other and efforts must be made to speak for all and not to call for the balkanization of the Lugardian Contraption. Sowore's vision is to have a borderless African continent in the way and manner our Pan-Africanist ancestor, Kwame Nkrumah envisaged. His positions are on the internet. Sowore does not and has never advocated for the dissolution of the country although he has a right to do so. His anger, like mine, rests solely on the criminal minds ruining this blessed land of milk and honey. While it is within the rights of anyone to fault the methods and timing of his many interventions including the most recent, #RevolutionNow, what is unacceptable is his traducers’ penchant at distorting his motives and passion at seeing that this present order of blood and death is put to an end. A country peopled by individuals who fail to appreciate little things will find it unworthy to reckon with the heavy sacrifices a few persons from amongst them make. Whether the despotic government of Muhammadu Buhari frees Sowore or not, I have no doubt that individuals averse to the rot in this society will keep up with the momentum as a means to end this condition of suffering and sin firmly in place in Nigeria . The government arrested Sowore in body thinking they could get a hold of his soul. Those championing #FreeSowore should at least be consoled that no one on earth has the capacity to chain a body whose mind is free. I congratulate Sowore. Sooner than later, Nigerians will rescue Nigeria."
,The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide,,http://saharareporters.com/2017/12/07/teflon-president-nine-lives-his-way-out-dr-wumi-akintide,"You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives? Not by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics. You would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary  even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming  to be the smartest President America has ever put in office. What is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God’s own country. In cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President. Even though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a “dump.” The guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard. It doesn’t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the “C” average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America’s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Donald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House. The one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin.  He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen. The Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to “make America great again,” as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House. Even though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent. My point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again. Ii is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year. If Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life. I seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he  lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source. Gerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe. George Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his “read my lips” pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President. I gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward. Republicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world. Republicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by “grabbing their pussies” because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything. Republicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years. Republicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years. They elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman’s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea. Republicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor. The list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as “fake news” disseminators. He has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few. What atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do.  Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it. It is a complete outrage and totally incredible! I rest my case.

According to Dele Momodu, Publisher of Ovation magazine, Otedola “personally confirmed” the news to him, meaning he may potentially run against Akinwunmi Ambode, the incumbent Governor, or Jide Sanwonolu, Bola Tinubu's favourite, one of whom is likely to emerge candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in 2019. ""Breaking news: Lagos 2019 promises to be interesting. PDP offers Femi Otedola governorship ticket. He's accepted and personally confirmed to The Boss newspaper,"" Momodu wrote. Breaking news: Lagos 2019 promises to be interesting. PDP offers Femi Otedola governorship ticket. He's accepted and personally confirmed to The Boss newspaper... Otedola’s emergence comes a day after Ambode officially declared interest in a second term, telling supporters at Alausa: “In these three and a half years as your Governor, I have seen visible proof that we can achieve unbelievable things when we all come together with no more than our belief in our dreams.  “We achieved because you believed. But there is still a lot more to be done. But I am not daunted. I am not tired. And I am sure you feel the same way because we all envision a better Lagos, a Lagos of our dreams. “So, I humbly call you again, to give me your support as I seek to continue with your mandate to steer the affairs of our State. I ask you to believe again and together, let’s achieve more,” Governor Ambode said."
,Rain Destroys Shelters For Displaced Nigerians,,http://saharareporters.com/2019/08/23/rain-destroys-shelters-displaced-nigerians,"
 
   Torrential rain has destroyed makeshift tents and caused severe flooding to temporary displacement camps in northeast Nigeria, leaving vulnerable families homeless. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said it was worried about the situation and thus appealed for ""urgent financial assistance"" to address the colossal humanitarian needs and to prevent the spread of deadly cholera. “Displaced people are suffering due to relentless rains and wind battering their homes the last few days. Large numbers of families, who fled from conflict months ago, are left homeless while others are forced to share overcrowded tents with neighbours or relatives,” said Eric Batonon, Country Director for NRC in Nigeria. According to NRC's assessments, over 6,800 people living in displacement camps in Maiduguri have been impacted by floods in recent weeks. In Dikwa, 500 people have been rendered homeless due to flooding and have set up home in disused registration centres. “They are essentially displaced within a displacement camp,” Batonon added. “My home is completely destroyed. My floor has turned to mud and water is everywhere. The rain keeps coming and we do not have any choice but to wait for it to stop or share with others,” said displaced mother-of-four Fatima Mohammed (30). The Adamawa State government, the organization said, had officially declared an outbreak of cholera in three local government areas during the rainy season. The total number of cases reported as of August 16 stands at 633. Four people have so far lost their lives to the disease. Due to recent heavy rain and flooding, more cases could be confirmed over the coming weeks, the NRC pointed out. “Displaced people are living in sub-human conditions across the region. There are no sanitation or drainage facilities in most camps. People are going to the toilet in open spaces because there are no facilities for them to use and now that the camps are filled with stagnant floodwater, water-borne diseases like cholera quickly spread,” Batonon added. Meanwhile, the United Nations and partners have appealed for $848 million to address the needs in northeast Nigeria this year. About eight months into the year, less than 40 per cent has been received. “Additional financial support is urgently needed to reach the 6.2 million people targeted for humanitarian aid in 2019. People will die if they don´t receive urgent assistance now,” Batonon said. Furthermore, heavy rain periods present opportunities by armed groups to infiltrate and target displacement camps. On Tuesday night (August 20) in Dikwa, a female suicide bomber detonated a bomb, killing herself and injuring four civilians. This was the first attack of its kind in the area since December 2018."
,Walter’s Wake-keep By Rudolf Ogoo Okonkwo,,http://saharareporters.com/2019/06/09/walter%E2%80%99s-wake-keep-rudolf-ogoo-okonkwo,"
 
 In the Boston metropolitan area is a Liberian who loved to attend Nigerian parties. (Let us call him Walter, because we have no permission to use his real name.) He loved Nigerian music, jollof rice, pepper soup, Shoki dance and watching Nigerians spray dollar bills like snow flakes at these parties. Trust Nigerians in America, they come up with every reason to throw a party - child dedication, wedding anniversary, birthday, graduation, send-off, wake-keep, etc. Every party is special but none is as special as a wake-keep. If you rent a hall to celebrate your 50th birthday or 25th wedding anniversary, or even your child's 5th birthday, or your child’s dedication in church, the general feeling is that you have the money to spare. People will still come, enjoy, and may even give you gifts, but it is mostly not seen as obligatory. But when it is a wake-keep, the party from conception to execution is aimed at raising money to assist the bereaved to go home and attend the funeral of the dead. The MC makes that clear every ten minutes of the event. And since people are expected to ""drop something,"" organizers make sure that there are a lot of food and drinks to justify the things people will ""drop"". Another feature of these wake-keep, other than the fact that most of those for whom the events are held had never been to America, is that there is an unwritten understanding between the organizers and the attendees that whatever the attendee gives is documented, noted and permanently preserved for the time when it would be necessary to return the favor. In Igbo community, they even have a proverb that backs it up. It says: whatever a man gives to another man is a loan waiting to be repaid. This last part accounts for the proliferation of wake-keep. It is like a form of isusu. You wait for your turn to collect return on your investments. Those who had lost their parents before coming to America waste no time in holding wakes for their uncles and aunts, not minding whether they were close or not.  Some will roll out the wake-keep red carpet for their step-mothers and step-fathers, even if they never saw eye-to-eye in life. All that they needed to say was that their parents died when they were young and it was this uncle, this aunt, this step-father, this step-mother, even step-sister and step-brother that stepped in and raised them. Who are you to argue with a grieving fellow? After all, the ever-increasing cost of burial at home means that no matter who dies, once the 3 am call comes, the demand for money follows. And having someone abroad means pressure to go for “a befitting” oversea-higher-standard burial. Wake-keep is so ubiquitous that people now simplify it by saying Peter's wake or Angela's wake, instead of properly labeling it as the wake of Peter's father or Angela's mother. It saves everyone the headache of figuring out the real relationship. Once you are part of the wake-keep-going circus, it is expected that, sooner or later, you will get your own wake. One guy having difficulty completing his house in the village manufactured his own wake out of the death of his maternal grandmother. Recently, the expectation of going home for the funeral has been waived. It is now acceptable that the person who collected all those money at the wake did not even go home for the funeral. That he or she presumably sent the money home is satisfactory. Wakes of Nigerian-Americans who died in America is a different ball game. Some consider that the more legitimate kind of wake. Friends and associates sympathize more and understand the need to raise money to support the family and in some cases, to transport the body back to Nigeria. Though recently there has been the increasing grumble for Nigerian-Americans to obtain life insurance to cover transportation of their body home, if they so wish, and still leave something for those they left behind. Walter is a permanent fixture at these wakes. He drinks to his heart’s desire, dances until his waist aches. He once inquired about joining People's Club after he watched the display of the club members at some of these wakes, but he pulled back when told how much it costs to join the club. Then, one day, Walter's mother died. And Walter had his wake. He contacted his Nigerian friends who told him how to plan a wake. He did not have close friends to constitute his Committee of Friends so he became his own one-man Committee of Friends. He did all the running-around and spent all the money needed for drinks, hall, DJ, photographer and food. On the day of the wake, Nigerians came in large numbers. They ate, drank, danced, and, went home. The morning after Walter's wake, he went to the office of a friend of mine who had given him $50. The average money given at these wakes is $100. Walter thanked my friend so profusely that my friend found it odd. Something a phone call would have taken care of, Walter came in person.  When Walter left, my friend called around to find out why Walter was super appreciative. Could it be because someone who didn’t know him very well gave him $50? What my friend found out was that all those Nigerians who came, ate, drank, danced, and then went home, none gave Walter any money because he never gave any money at all those wakes he had attended over the years. ……."

It is always so good to hear that: Excellency. It is wonderful. People like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, they never call me that. “It is not a problem, Excellency. I know you are very busy, Excellency. They said you wanted me to call you?” “Oh really, who? You know we are so busy with the COVID-19 pandemic here. 
 
 “Of course, Excellency. You know I am working from home these days. So I watch everything on CNN.” “You watch the Fake News? No, you should be watching Fox News. I work from home too; I call it ‘Watching from home.’ So much fun like you wouldn’t believe.” “Sorry about the loss of so many American lives, Excellency, almost 60,000.” “Yes, thank you. It could have been much more, but we are doing a tremendous job all over the country. Mine is a very effective leadership. But how are you doing? They were telling me you have a major problem in Cano.” “Oh, Kano. Yes. But it was just a misunderstanding. We have it under control. All we need now are ventilators.” “Ventilators. Oh yes. Those are in very high demand all over the world. Everyone wants them. I had to tell our governors to fend for themselves. But we have enough now in our stockpile, and I am expecting a lot more. We will be helping Italy, France and Spain.” “Your Excellency, you must also help Nigeria. We are a good friend of the US. We will do anything you ask, Excellency.” “Anything I ask? I like the sound of that. I remember that when you visited me two years ago, I requested fairness and reciprocity in our relations. We give Nigeria annual aid of over $1bn, but you have huge trade barriers preventing US businesses from investing there.” “Trade barriers, Excellency? If any, we will dismantle them without delay. We want US investment.” “I could actually authorise the ventilators today, but they are in such demand.” “Excellency, we beg of you. Elon Must refused to give us 500. Please just 100 or 200.” “You think that would be enough?” “More than enough, walahi Excellency!” “But you have a population of 200 million.” “Yes Excellency, but we have no hospitals to place them. I use foreign hospitals myself. No problem” “So you may have a distribution problem then.” “Not at all. I will give three each to some states, one in some cases, and none to some states at all, and I will keep the rest here at the presidency. More than enough.” “Why one in some states and zero in others?” “Oh Excellency, the PDP states are those that will get one, out of my generosity, because they are the ones that didn’t build hospitals or buy ventilators. Those that get zero are those that didn’t vote for us.” “Oh, the Democrats!” “No, Excellency, we are the Democrats, the Progressives.” “But aren’t they PDP…the Democrats? Anyhow, you can save a lot of money and buy a lot of ventilators if you want. I mean, you are getting back $321m of Sani Abacha’s looted funds from us. If you resist the temptation to give part of that to a state governor, you could really do a lot.” “But Excellency…” “And there are records of all these former governors and ministers and senators who are double and triple-dipping or fleecing their states under terrible pension laws, some of them dating as far back as 18 or 19 years.” “Those are just rumours, Excellency. Many of them are our friends, and they have told us they never did any such thing. It is just like Sani Abacha; he never looted anyone, that is just a name. But believe me, if you send us the ventilators, we will soon be curving the flat all over Nigeria.” “You mean, flattening the curve. I will see about the ventilators, but they may not be available for three or four or five months or end of the year. Some of these things are not easy. Remember the 12 A29 Tucano jets you overpaid for? I know you were hoping to get them by 2020, but that will not happen before 2023.You may more quickly receive the 12 Mi-35 helicopters you signed with Russia in October last year.” “Thank you, Excellency. I will have my ambassador follow-up on the ventilators. Maybe we will be lucky.” “Ambassador? You mean you have an ambassador here in Washington, DC?” “Mmm Excellency. Do you mean you have not seen him? I will check. I remember nominating one old man…twice. I remember this because he was even older than me. That is one of the reasons we really need these ventilators. Otherwise we will never deepen the curve.” “Flatten the curve, you mean. But are you aggressively testing? Your numbers seem so low!” “Oh yes Excellency, we are testing. We test everyone who looks suspicious. We just don’t want to waste test kits.” “That is rather interesting. I hadn’t thought of that. But in the US I am doing a fantastic job. We are testing better than anybody on earth and we have tests like you wouldn’t believe. But what do you intend to do about power?” “Power? No problem, Excellency. I am quite strong. I can race anyone.” “No, not your muscles. Electricity. Ventilators are very sensitive equipment. Fluctuating power can easily damage them. How will you power them?” “Oh, electricity? Walahi only some people have that problem. In Aso Rock we have generators. Then backup generators to backup the generators. We even have backup generators to backup the generators which backup NEPA.” “NEPA?” “Sorry, Excellency. NEPA is what we call public power supply. My children told me the company now has a new name. But don’t you worry, we will get it right. We will even get EFCC to count the generators every night. They will not disappear like loot from the Abacha years.” “That is reassuring. But you know, your country could have really benefitted from that ‘Power Up Africa’ Obama was pursuing. But I am told your country never showed interest.” ‘Power Up Africa’? I am sure it was PDP who blocked it. APC is NEXT LEVEL performance. No problem.” “What about maintenance?” “Maintenance? We don’t worry about that. We always buy new ones, whether jets, cars or generators, and throw away the old.” “No, I mean maintenance of the ventilators. These are very sophisticated equipment. Like a car…very high-quality. Many doctors and nurses have never seen it before. If people are learning on the job to use them, people die.” “Dying, Excellency? Nobody dies in Aso Rock!” “’Excellency.’ Music to my ears. But with no oil being sold, no planting being done, no trading in the land, and little importation likely, what about that thundering hunger and anger?” “That is okay, Mr. President. This place is protected by hundreds of soldiers and hundreds of policemen.” “Sounds like a plan! You got your ventilators!!”"
,Trump's Trial Or Triumph? By Hannatu Musawa,,http://saharareporters.com/2019/11/05/trumps-trial-or-triumph-hannatu-musawa,"
 
   A near impossible and rare feat is to impeach a United States' president. The president must have committed, either bribery, treason or other serious crimes or misdemeanors. Even at that, in the present clime, it is almost impossible to believe that the Republican members of Congress in the Senate would pass such a bill if presented with one by the lower House of Representatives.  After the American civil war and President Abraham Lincoln’s death, his Vice President, Andrew Johnson became the 17th president of the US, Johnson, had radical ideas and constantly was at loggerheads with the Congress by vetoing certain bills.  In 1867 when he replaced the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, a man appointed by Lincoln who supported the Radical Republicans, a breakaway group of the party who believed in the civil rights of freed African Americans, Congress pushed hard and presented eleven articles of impeachment alleging that President Johnson had violated what is known as the “Tenure of Office Act”, that is, a law meant to limit presidential power to remove federal appointees from office without consulting the Senate.  Eventually, in 1868, President Johnson was successfully impeached by a two- thirds majority of the House. This act was deemed unconstitutional years later by the Supreme Court. President Johnson was not removed from office because a single vote from seven Republicans who voted with the Democrats saved his position.  A Historian, Hans L. Trefousse wrote, “The weakness of the case convinced many that the charges were largely political and that the violation of the Tenure of Office Act constituted neither a crime nor a violation of the Constitution but merely a pretext for Johnson’s opponents.”  Interestingly, this historic case set the tone in Washington for future Presidential impeachments to follow, namely that no President should ever be impeached for political reasons but should be impeached for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors” as clearly stated by the U.S. Constitution.  Using the same paintbrush of which hunting for political reasons, the White House has repeatedly dismissed claims by the Democrats that top government officials had pressured leaders of other nations, namely Ukraine, to investigate the former U.S.  Vice President and 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in the personal and political interest of President Trump. President Trump has been quoted publicly as bragging that the Democrats have “no grounds to impeach.” He claims he has done “nothing wrong or illegal” in light of the formal impeachment proceedings against him recently. In 1972, when the Watergate scandal broke, the 37th president of the US, Richard, Nixon struggled to cover up his direct involvement in the burgling and trespassing of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate office complex in Washington. The scandal was intertwined with multiple cases of abuse of power of officials of the Nixon administration, which culminated in the commencement of an impeachment process against him. Apart from the overwhelming evidence of cash found on the five burglars of the DNC headquarters leading back to Nixon’s Staff, the investigation revealed that President Nixon had a tape recording system in his offices where private conversations were recorded.  After grueling court battles, the Supreme Court ruled that the President was obligated to release the infamous tapes to government investigators. The tapes bore damning evidence that President Nixon was irrefutably involved in the break-in of the DNC office and abuse of power to cover up the investigation. In light of a predictable impeachment, on 9 August 1974, Nixon resigned his turbulent presidency. “Watergate” the name became synonymous with political or public scandal not just in the United States but globally as well.  On October 8, 1998, the United States House of Representatives commenced impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the U.S. under the accusation of “high crimes and misdemeanors"". The reasons were for lying under oath and obstruction of justice tied to the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Clinton by a woman named Paula Jones. This would be the second time an American president would be impeached where the House formally adopted the articles of impeachment and forwarded them to the Senate for adjudication. I remember vividly the frenzy by paparazzi when the proceedings of impeachment began in January 1999 with the Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding. After sensational interviews and depositions, President Bill Clinton was acquitted on February 12, 1999, on both counts of high crimes and misdemeanors as neither charges received the necessary two- thirds majority vote of the Senators present for conviction and removal from office. President Bill Clinton remained in office for the rest of his second term.  In a whirlwind twist and amidst probably one of the most surprising outcomes of a U.S. Presidential election held on 8 November 2016, Donald Trump defeated the former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and became the 45th president of the United States. This was a massive blow to the Democrats who had fought a long and grueling campaign riddled with maliciousness and allegations of the infamous email messages that were deleted by Hillary Clinton’s team whilst she was in office.  Donald J. Trump won the Electoral College with 304 votes compared to 227 votes for Hillary Clinton despite pre-election nationwide polls that predicted she would win. Globally women had been excited as her victory would have been a symbol of gender equality with a female being the leader of the free world, the great United States of America, land of dreams. It was a bitter defeat for billions all over the world.   Almost immediately, President Trump’s presidency was riddled in controversies, accusations, and scandals amidst a chaotic White House. One could say that ultimately Hillary Clinton may have had the last laugh after all. The White House Staff were either dismissed or they quit by themselves and replaced on a regular basis, even the press struggled to keep up with the changes. A massive scandal subsequently broke out alleging that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election and the President took great pains to undermine the investigation.  It posed a threat to national security and made a mockery of the American voting system. The Russia scandal, the firing of James Comey (former FBI Director), resignation of Michael Flynn (former national adviser) and many more obstacles in his administration proved this to be the most troubled presidency in modern history. All this was happening amidst a barrage of regular tweets from the President on his official account on social media, which most see as unbecoming and entirely inappropriate for a President in office.  The latest Ukraine scandal was triggered by President Trump’s alleged efforts to coerce Ukraine and other countries to provide damaging information about the 2020 Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. President Trump was said to have pressured his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General, Bill Barr and other parties outside his administration to influence politics in Washington.  The 2016 Presidential election scandal also has not disappeared.  In the middle of September 2019, Trump's misuse of power to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign came into the full glare of the public because of a whistleblower statement made in August 2019. Then on 24 September 2019, the House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry led by six House Committees and the House voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry on 31 October 2019.  To impeach President Trump, a majority is required in the House and for conviction or removal from office a two- thirds “super majority” is required in the senate. The whole world waits and watches the outcome of the impeachment as they also wonder whether President Trump who could so aptly be described as the cat with nine lives (having emerged seemingly unscathed by each scandal) would survive the latest misconduct.  The question remains: Will this be Trump's triumph or trial? We only have a short while left to see as the political games in the United States continue to unravel."
Elections,Tinubu All Smiles As Sanwo-Olu Receives Certificate Of Return,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/03/29/tinubu-all-smiles-sanwo-olu-receives-certificate-return,"Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was the most notable name in attendance as Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State Governor-Elect, and his running mate Obafemi Hamzat received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at a ceremony held at the commission’s office in Yaba, Lagos Mainland, on Friday. Clad in Agbada with caps to match, the Governor-elect and his deputy were accompanied to the carnival-like event by their wives, associates, family members and APC leaders, including the party chairman in Lagos, Hon. Tunde Balogun; party leader, Prince Tajudeen Olusi; and former Minister of State for Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, among others.  At exactly 11:30am, INEC National Commissioner in charge of Lagos, Ondo and Ogun states, Dr. Adekunle Ogunmola, presented the certificate to Sanwo-Olu, charging the Governor-Elect to be magnanimous in victory. Sanwo-Olu received the certificate in company of his wife, Ibijoke. Ogunmola charged Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat to pursue reconciliation and close ranks with their opponents, reminding them that tolerance of opposition remains a key foundation of constitutional democracy.  The state’s Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Sam Olumekun, described Sanwo-Olu’s victory as rancour-free, noting that international observers adjudged the Lagos governorship election to be free, fair and credible. Pointing out that 45 political parties fielded governorship candidates in the election, Olumekun, however, lamented apathy among voters in some constituencies. He particularly made a reference to Eti-Osa Constituency 1, which recorded a four per cent voter turnout — a development he described as unprecedented.
 
 In his six-minute acceptance speech, Sanwo-Olu promised to lead “an all-inclusive government”, while extending a hand of fellowship to his opponents in the governorship race. He expressed joy that his victory was not tainted by violence and bloodshed. He specially paid tribute to President Muhammadu Buhar and Tinubu for displaying “responsible leadership”, which “led to victory of APC in Lagos and the centre”. He said: “Our resolve to lead the state as Governor and Deputy Governor is not about our personal welfare and that of our families, but a determination to build a state that all of us will be proud of. We will not disappoint Lagosians for the confidence reposed in us to lead on their behalf. We promise to lead a government that will be responsible and that will work for the greater majority of residents. “Whatever happened during the campaign period belongs to the past. It’s time for reconciliation and the state must move forward. Therefore, we will not engage anyone or group based on their political affiliation, ethnic nationality or whether they voted for us or not, we are all Lagosians and we will run a government that will work for all.”"
,For Femi Falana and Kunle Ajibade: Sixty Hurrahs to Courage and Conviction By Ogaga Ifowodo,,http://saharareporters.com/2018/06/15/femi-falana-and-kunle-ajibade-sixty-hurrahs-courage-and-conviction-ogaga-ifowodo,"
 
 I was twenty-three and in the first semester of my final year as a law student at the University of Benin. He was thirty and already a rising star in the legal profession, though still under the wing of the urbane but ever battle-ready Alao Aka-Bashorun. I had recently ceased to be Secretary-General of the Students Union and Opeyemi Bamidele (now literally taking the bullets of enemies of democracy in our land) newly sworn in as the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, pending the election to constitute a new executive. And it was the matter of the election that led to my “indefinite suspension” — along with Bamidele and two others, in the first instance (eight more followed suit, besides the president of the union) — thereby almost confirming my father’s fear the day I informed him of my intention to run for a Students Union office: that I did not intend to graduate! Still smarting from our victory in the fight for the restoration of the union at Uniben — following the unconstitutional ban on student union activities in the wake of the nationwide protests sparked by the murder of four Ahmadu Bello University students by anti-riot policemen precipitately called to quell a peaceful protest (Professor Ango Abdullahi, the vice chancellor, would further outrage the nation by announcing that “only four students died” as if one were not too many) — Professor Grace Alele-Williams sought to pacify her campus for General Babangida, the reigning military dictator, by issuing intolerable election guidelines. Candidates were to submit their manifestoes for vetting; were not to use university policy as a campaign issue; must not belong to campus associations (this aimed at disqualifying members of the “banned” League of Patriotic Students, resurrected as the Cultural Awareness Club, our group); possession of a minimum Grade Point Average of 2.75; and disqualification without reason. Why call it an election, you might ask, but we were then in the early years of Babangida’s political witchcraft, hence his dying need to pacify the campuses by emasculating the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), as well as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), arguably the only organised opposition at the time to the burgeoning military terror. Our suspension was punishment for rallying the students against the obnoxious guidelines, for calling “on students to boycott” the elections and — of course, they had to add this — “incit[ing] them to violence and demonstration.” But that was hardly our only crime. At the time of the second petrol price increase by Babangida from 39.5 kobo to 42 kobo per litre — yes, the national currency did have value once upon a time! — the union had barely been inaugurated and so we lacked the platform for an effective protest, with the University of Jos, I believe, leading the way then. Then Babangida gave us a chance to salve our festering wound of non-participation: the students unions of the universities that shunned “violence” by not protesting would each be given an eighteen-seater bus to commend their “maturity.” Promptly, we made clear what kind of praise or gifts the University of Benin union would accept by holding a rally and rejecting the bribe outright. But the true test of the union’s character followed quickly when the university decided to cancel resit examinations. Resits gave a second chance, a lifeline even, to struggling students, many of whom were indigent, some constrained to do menial work in town to see themselves through school, and who still had to cope with poor living conditions, and non-existent or inadequate learning materials as libraries and laboratories were sapped to “death” by the IMF/World Bank’s Structural Adjustment Programme, imposed by Babangida on the nation despite its total rejection by the people. Whatever the merits of the decision, the students would accept it only if living and learning conditions were improved, even if by a mere fifty percent. The vice-chancellor would not budge and challenged me, as the perceived recalcitrant mouthpiece of the students, to a debate. The entire university trooped to the quadrangle of the Faculty of Social Sciences to be schooled on how misguided the new students union was. As it happened, she lost the argument and was constrained to restore resit exams for the time being. That was the last straw. Something had to be done. And so disregarding our request to examine the evidence and witnesses against us, and for adequate time to prepare our response to the charges of holding a rally, and incitement to demonstration and violence, the university proceeded at break-neck speed to hand us what, in effect, were expulsion letters. I took the query, our responses, and the suspension letters to Femi Falana in Lagos, meeting him at home in Ketu where he lived at the time. On the principle of fair hearing alone, our suspension would be annulled by the court, but what to do about the ubiquitous cast-iron ouster clauses in the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree, the Federal Military Government (Supremacy and Enforcement of Powers) Decree, recently reiterated in the Students Union Activities (Control and Regulation) Decree 47? Falana saw a way out. He would bring to aid the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, already ratified and domesticated, which, as an international treaty, Nigeria was obligated to enforce in her courts. By sheer coincidence, the late Justice James Omo-Agege of the former Bendel State High Court was assigned the case, Bamidele & Ors v The University of Benin. He had been one of the resource persons who helped birth the Charter during his time as an expatriate jurist in The Gambia. He was more than happy to give it life, though the university’s failure to adhere to its enabling Act had already simplified the task for him. He voided our suspension/expulsion. I lost a semester but returned to complete my LL.B with honours, though Professor Alele-Williams would withhold my faculty reference form and prevent my admission into the Nigeria Law School until a month before the bar exam, the battle for my admission waged administratively this time by Mr Aka-Bashorun himself. He was thirty and I was twenty-three when we first met. I, a law student with his head in law and his heart in poetry and literature, and he a copy writer with the defunct Grant Advertising at an indifferent address on Bode Thomas Street, Surulere, Lagos. Kunle Ajibade, would soon after wend his way to the newsrooms of The Guardian, The African Concord, and TheNEWS magazine and Tempo newspaper, the last two as co-founder and editor. I don’t recall precisely the occasion of our first meeting — whether the 1988 Association of Nigerian Authors annual conference at the National Theatre or on one of my many truant jaunts to Lagos to attend this or that reading — but whichever it was, I suspect that I was introduced by the late poet Idzia Ahmad, Ajibade’s colleague at Grant. It was in his days at The African Concord, however, that I really got to know Ajibade. With the encouragement of Lewis Obi, its editor, and Ohi Alegbe, copy editor, I had begun contributing articles to its pages. And then in 1993 I won the Association of Nigerian Authors poetry prize with an unpublished manuscript, what became Homeland and Other Poems. Ajibade who had begun a series of long interviews of established authors for Weekend Concord, was, it seemed, almost as delighted as my euphoric self and interviewed me for his report as if I were already a bona fide poet, thereby doing wonders for my budding writer’s ego! But literature is one thing and real life another. And so it was that soon after that we would both be in the trenches during the vicious days of the Babangida/Abacha tyranny that culminated in the cruellest evil perpetrated against democracy and our sovereign right to self-determination: the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election. Jailed for life, he was, by a military tribunal set up to confirm verdicts already reached before the charges were framed. Ajibade’s offence had been no more than publishing General Obasanjo’s statement in denial of the ridiculous charge of accessory before the fact of treason, making Ajibade’s offence purportedly that of being an accessory after the fact of treason! Whenever anyone quite solicitously wondered how I coped with six months of preventive detention, I always said that I got away lightly and would cite Ajibade among other human rights and democracy activists given life imprisonment sentences, or who had spent well over a year in the Babangida/Abacha gulag, Ajibade having done three-and-a-half years before freedom came in the wake of his jailer’s death. I was amused when Ngugi wa Thiong’o conceded to Ajibade the status of “older jailbird” during a conversation with him at the 2016 Ake Arts and Book festival in Abeokuta because he had himself spent only one year in Arap Moi’s prison. Jailed for life, but the people on whose side he fought, as the rest of the world, hailed him for a life courageously lived. As they hail Falana who in those days walked through revolving doors to prison cells and SSS dungeons. Among his peers and even succeeding generations, Falana stands tall as a people’s solicitor and advocate, insisting on seeing law as a tool of social engineering rather than merely as a genteel profession of self-satisfied practitioners, best served without a conscience, by keeping silent in the face of tyranny or, even better, taking the side of diabolical governments. For his part, Ajibade was editor of Tempo, the underground newspaper set up by TheNEWS crew after their magazine had been proscribed. These two tribunes of truth and justice recently marked their sixtieth anniversary in a beautiful land made almost unliveable on any proper index of healthy living, where the average life expectancy is a bleak fifty-four years, placing us behind 215 other countries in the world and 15 in Africa. They can’t hear me, but I am shouting sixty hurrays in the first instance, and sixty more (for I wish them a very long life), in tribute to their extraordinary courage."
Elections,INEC Asks Nigerians To Figure Out If They Really Want More 100 Political Parties,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/04/01/inec-asks-nigerians-figure-out-if-they-really-want-more-100-political-parties,"The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it is up to Nigerians to decide if the proliferation of political parties will offer something new for the country. According to the commission, the electoral process is getting more complicated, especially with more parties registering to participate in elections. In the February 23 general election, 73 parties fielded presidential candidates while more than 90 parties were approved to participate in the elections. Speaking at the presentation of certificates of return to Samuel Ortom, Governor of Benue State, his deputy and members of the state House of Assembly in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, over the weekend, Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and chairman of the Information and Voter Education Committee, noted that while the commission had the constitutional powers to deregister a political party, it was up to Nigerians to decide if they wanted to continue with the proliferation of parties. His words: “INEC believes that the Nigerian people need a national conversation on the regime of political parties and their administration. The Nigerian people must on their own, through elected representatives determine whether we need, and can accommodate over a hundred political parties in our electoral process. We must decide whether the constitutional conditions for the registration of political parties are adequate to make for the registration of political parties that genuinely sponsor candidates and have something new to offer to the Nigerian people. “The ballot papers are getting more complicated for the Nigerian people. Sorting, counting and entering the scores of candidates in Form EC8A series is becoming more cumbersome. Polls are closing late on account of the number of parties and ad hoc staff of the commission in remote areas and difficult terrains are exposed to danger. “It is also becoming difficult husbanding and protecting result sheets from the polling units to the collation centres as armed gangs are getting more vicious when targeting result sheets of the commission. It is therefore imperative that Nigerians hold a national conversation on the number of political parties and the requirements for their registration. “While the commission can deregister parties that fail to meet the constitutional threshold embedded in the 4th Alteration to the constitution, it takes deregistered parties 30 days to make a comeback as a registered political party can reapply and get registered on the liberal conditions in the constitution. It is also imperative for the commission to proceed and implement the duality of manual and electronic collation and transmission.” On the importance of supplementary elections, he continued: “The concept of supplementary elections and the application of the margin of lead principle in our electoral process are not insidious or alien to our electoral process. It is a constitutional provision that gives life and meaning to the vote and the sovereign right of the people to decide who governs them. The commission is of the firm opinion that it is unconstitutional and illegal to disenfranchise a whole community based on its inability to deploy materials and personnel on account of logistic challenges. It will be unjust and inequitable to disenfranchise a people based on a vicious determination by political opponent to reduce the votes from targeted communities through contrived mayhem and insecurity. “The voices and votes of the people will be meaningless if the commission is forced to retreat from conducting elections in certain communities. It will be inequitable to deprive the people of the power of the vote despite natural disasters or other emergencies that prevented them from exercising their mandate. “It is against the law to reward people who deliberately undermine the use of the Smart Card Readers in the electoral process. The concept of margin of lead and the organization of supplementary elections are constitutional and electoral safeguards deliberately inserted in our laws and constitution to give meaning to the concept of the vote and prevent serial electoral violators from undermining the electoral process. “What the Nigerian people need is a robust, honest, professional and ethical security architecture that secures the electoral environment and gives the vote the requisite voice. While constitutional and electoral reforms are inevitable, we must not become addicted to electoral and constitutional reforms at the slightest sight of contrived challenges and roadblocks.”"
,A Nation Of Accomplices By Modiu Olaguro,,http://saharareporters.com/2018/01/28/nation-accomplices-modiu-olaguro,"The transmogrification of Nigeria into a captive state, a century-long process embarked upon prior to the fusion of the northern and southern protectorates appears to have reached its plastic point in recent years. In physics, the plastic point is one wherein an elastic wire would cease to return to its original length upon stretching. With the spate of unabated killings and stomach politicking, nationals await the miracle their leaders would deplore to remove Nigeria from the parlous position it currently occupies. From Nigeria down to Zimbabwe, India through Pakistan, the notoriety of the British never to forget to leave a problem in every country she colonized for them to chew until eternity continues to remain a formidable platform upon which the cracks in those nations manifest. Sadly for Africa, the actors who fought under the siege of Black Nationalism reclaimed their lands only to replace white supremacy with tribal bigotry, a volte-face amongst these scorched-earth creatures whose touted intelligence, sophistication and power of reasoning cease to function once the double-faced weaponry of religion and ethnicity is bandied right to their very faces! 
 
Their diverse nature, rich histories and alluring cultures—powerful combos whose nuances ought to be recognised, respected and brought together to forge an indomitable front have but become the major fulcrum upon which all manner of division and hate is spewed, an unfortunate reality which signals to the correctness of the words of the black existentialist philosopher and pragmatic revolutionary, Frantz Fanon that “national consciousness is nothing but a crude, empty fragile shell. The cracks in it explain how easy it is for young independent countries to switch back from nation to ethnic group and from state to tribe—a regression which is so terribly detrimental and prejudicial to the development of the nation and national unity.” It is this rapid switch to our parochial instincts that has reduced the country to a big-for-nothing giant, a condition exacerbated by our embrace of a “lootocratic” form of government as against a flourishing one, with very little to show for the massive wealth buried beneath the soil, rarities on top of it and most damning, the brilliant ideas within the skull of the people. With a switch so inimical to national progress and the spirit of Pan Africanism, character, merit and justice have got to make way for federal character and all what's not, creating an atmosphere wherein persons whose belief system bars them from loving life deny others their fair share of it. While the masses keep bickering amongst themselves over the terror of the herdsmen, fellow nationals from northern Nigeria whose detest for criminality is an open book have since been in a fix over the questioning of their loyalty as they grapple with an emotional nation which has succeeded, to the dismay of logic and reason, at reducing the glaring failure of leadership and an over-centralization of security apparatuses to an act of ethnic expansionism! With this mindset, the masses deny themselves core sympathizers on the other side of the divide at best, and at worst, play into the hands of an overt bigot, whose trifling use of “my fellow citizens” is at variance with his sectional outlook and a lack of appreciation of the richness in people beyond his parochial subconscious, with neither age nor ascension to the highest office to preside over the affairs of a multifarious nation having any effect on his person. With Nigeria, one cannot be too surprised on the sound of a barrel or the sight of a club. But recent events, which culminated in the making of the middle belt into a vast morgue and the rest of the country, a hellish abode have further thrust the nation on the brink of collapse. These further reinforce my position that should Nigerians not wake up from their collective slumber by first recognizing that the only enemy they have got are the characters that make up the rank and file of the leadership cadre, redefine their country and situate their place in it, our slip into anomie would only intensify. A place to begin is the kind of country we all desire to live in. It is the propounding of such a vision that has made the American, America; the French, France; and the Russian, Russia; with these nations having sons and daughters who embody in totality, the aspirations and yearnings of their respective lands—not hesitating whatsoever to live or die for their countries in the furtherance of such noble ideals. One clarity in the Nigerian state is the rarity of statemen—men and women whose duties lie, strictly, in the promotion and propagation of the common good. From the north down south, through the trenches of delta, the nation longs for a father. It is this absence of a national patriarch that has made way for all manner of charlatans and opportunists to abrogate such tasking responsibility to themselves, audacious among them being ex-president Obasanjo, the impish general whose continued relevance in the public space is tied to the chronic affliction of collective forgetfulness amongst the people on one side, and the very position the country occupies as a failed state on the other. With the call for restructuring exceeding the desirable decibels since the days of the inept and corrupt administration of Goodluck Jonathan and raging with fire and brimstone since the pretentious and complicit presidency of Muhammadu Buhari, the debate on the sustainability of the Lugardian project has never been this visible on the spot. The nation more than ever needs brave men who are certain of their convictions to put forward viable alternatives and defend their arguments with uncommon bravado. Restructuring or otherwise, it would not require much from men with convictions to recognise that irrespective of the structure or system of government we adopt as a people, our entanglement with the hefty baggage of official corruption and treachery would remain until the masses realise their place within the space they call theirs, fashion their country in line with the vision so conceived and put structures in place for the sustenance and continuation of such. The shirking away from this noble venture of statehood stands as the greatest stumbling block against our longing to make a nation from Nigeria, with everyone caught up in the web of hate and individualism while the unfortunate, albeit succinct words of the respected premier of the defunct western region, Chief Awolowo of Nigeria not being a country but a mere geographical expression continue to remain as the most fitting descriptor of our nation several decades later. Until the masses themselves realise, paraphrasing Kwame Ture, that there is a higher law than the law of a hypocrite named Obasanjo, a higher law than the law of a bigot named Buhari, and a much higher one than those made by the tools in the national assembly, the leadership space would continue to remain an abode for self-acclaimed democrats whose motive for venturing into politics is strictly to steal, kill and destroy. With 19% (16 million) of the total workforce unemployed and 21% (18 million) underemployed according to the Q3 2017 Employment By Sector Report of the National Bureau of Statistics; 1 in 5 children dying before the age of five according to the World Health Organisation and an unacceptable fatality rate amongst child bearers, Nigerians must stop being accomplices to the subjugation of their existence by their fellow citizens. Going by the level of rot and the very fact that the nation keeps going adrift, hope appears to have eluded this generation. Will the people throw their hats in the ring to salvage the next?

The Governor of CBN, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this at the unveiling of the THISDAY Dome Testing, Tracing and Treatment Centre, Abuja, on Tuesday. Emefiele said if Nigeria was to wait for foreign countries to develop their vaccines, it would be the last in the queue to receive curative remedies for the teeming population. 
 
 He said, “The CBN today challenges Nigerian scientists at home and in the Diaspora to go back to their laboratories and develop a Nigerian vaccine. Once validated by the Health Authorities, the CBN will step in and do the needful for the sake of over 200 million Nigerians now confronted by COVID-19. “Our inability to accurately predict the extent to which the Coronavirus could spread, and how long it would last, requires that we build sufficient capacity within our health system to contain the spread of the virus, state by state, city by city and preserve the lives of vulnerable Nigerians. “This requires that we all come together to support the work of the Presidential Task Force in its determination to save lives and stem the pandemic.” He however, commended the Nigerian private sector, who had come together under the Coalition against COVID-19 to support the government, by raising funds to provide needed isolation centres, medical equipment among others. He disclosed that so far the CA-COVlD-19 had raised up to N27bn to fund these initiatives, adding that these donations were being used to build well-equipped isolation centres across the 36 states of the federation.  "

Elections,APC Lawmaker Sues Dickson Over Election Violence In Bayelsa,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/04/01/apc-lawmaker-sues-dickson-over-election-violence-bayelsa,"
 
 Honourable Israel Sunny-Goli, the lawmaker representing Brass Constituency 1 in Bayelsa State House of Assembly, has filed a suit against Seriake Dickson, Governor of Bayelsa State, regarding the Commission of Inquiry set up to probe the violence that occurred in the state during the 2019 elections. He is seeking an order to declare the commission’s inquest illegal, null and void. The Governor had   to probe the violence that rocked the state during the presidential and National Assembly elections in various parts of the state. The Commission, which has begun sitting in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, has listened to chilling testimonies of various victims of the electoral violence prompting it to invite Sunny-Goli, former Governor Timipre Sylva, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, and Sam Kodjo as their names featured prominently in the testimonies of victims. Though all the invitees have shunned the invitation on the claim that the Commission of Inquiry was a “kangaroo” effort, Sunny-Goli, the House of Representatives member-elect for Nembe/Brass Constituency, has approached the court to seek some reliefs. 
 
    
 
 In the suit marked FHC/PHC/CS/69/2019 filed at the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Sunny-Goli, through his counsel, Stephen Topba is seeking, among other declarations, that the 8th defendant (Governor of Bayelsa State) “is not competent to constitute a commission of inquiry into any matter which falls outside the legislative competence of the Bayelsa State House of Assembly.” The lawmaker, who also sought a declaration for the commission of inquiry as an “illegal body that cannot validly invite or summon the plaintiff to appear before it”, further prayed that “the proceedings, hearings, meetings, deliberations, reports, resolutions, recommendations or any action already taken or to be taken by the Ist defendant (the Bayelsa State Commission of Inquiry) are illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever”. He is therefore seeking an order “setting aside the invitation and or summons” extended to him and an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Commission of Inquiry from continuing with proceedings and submitting a report. 
 
    
 
 Topba, in a cover letter attached to the court process served on the Commission, said Sunny-Goli is interested in getting justice. “In the view of the above, we respectfully request you to stay action on the proceedings of the Commission pending the determination of the above suit. We believe firmly that the precious time of the commission and the interest of justice will be better served if the said suit is  dispensed with as to the appropriateness or otherwise of the continual  existence of the Commission before further steps are taken on the assignment before the Commission,” the letter read. However, Dr. Richard Ogbe, Secretary of the Commission, said the Commission has not received any document on the matter from the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt."

Elections,APC BoT Member Reveals Why Buhari Lost Presidential Election In Ondo,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/04/03/apc-bot-member-reveals-why-buhari-lost-presidential-election-ondo,"Alhaji Ali Olanusi, a member of the Board of Trustees (BOT) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), has decried the level of anti-party activities of some members of the party in Ondo State in the recently concluded general election. According to Olanusi, President Muhammadu Buhari lost the election in Ondo State due to the anti-party activities that members of the party engaged in before the general election. He stated this on Wednesday at a stakeholders’ meeting held in Akure, the Ondo State capital, to appraise the performance of the ruling party in both the presidential and the national assembly election in Ondo State. The APC chieftain, who was also a Deputy Governor of Ondo State, accused Rotimi Akeredolu, Governor of Ondo State, of “initiating the members of APC in Ondo State into anti-party activities after failing to secure the party's tickets for his preferred candidates in the just concluded national assembly election”. Olanusi said Akeredolu orchestrated anti-party activities by directing the members of the APC in the state to work for some candidates of Action Alliance (AA) in the 2019 elections. The BOT member noted that though the stalwarts of the party had raised the alarm over the Governor’s anti-party activities, the party leadership failed to quickly act before the election. ""If Buhari had won the presidential election in Ondo State, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu would have gotten the credit despite working against the party in Ondo State. And we had envisaged this problem in Ondo State, and that is why we cried to the national leadership of the party on the anti-party activities of Governor Akeredolu. But they failed to listen to us, and didn't recognise our voice then. For me, I am for the growth and unity of the party and we shall progress. ""So, we must not allow the monster, who is an ingrate and has no fear of God, including respect for elders and colleagues, to come back and rule us here again. Let us not allow ourselves to be monetised by other politicians, but to educate our people while we should vote for the right candidate in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. ""We must learn how to come together and appreciate each other. A divided house cannot stand. We need to work as a team so that our party can move forward. We recorded 54 per cent in the 2015 presidential election when we didn't have APC as the state government. Now, as a state controlled by APC, we performed woefully.” In his remarks, Isaac Kekemeke, a former APC Chairman in the state, said the funds disbursed to Ondo by the party’s national leadership for the elections were diverted by Akeredolu. He said Akeredolu was the major financier of AA in Ondo State, and called on the party’s leaders to intervene before the 2020 Ondo governorship election. ""The Governor worked against the party and he really didn't want President Muhammadu Buhari to win the 2019 presidential election. So, they did not work for him in Ondo State, rather they all worked for their Action Alliance party,"" he said."

Ottih, a lawyer, had on May 4 in a Facebook post pleaded publicly to the state government to pay her colleagues and herself their over three months salaries. ""Nwamkpa Modestus (Uzodinma's SSA) my dearest brother, from the blood and water we share as brother and sister, and as colleague in the journalism profession, you are the closest officer of His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Imo State, Chief Hope Uzodinma (Onwa Oyoko) to me. 
 
 “Please my brother, help me inform our humble and performing governor that the entire staff of the only electronic media establishment owned by the state Imo Broadcasting Corporation, the famous Orient FM and Television have not received salaries for the month of February, March and April. ""It could be that His Excellency is not aware of this ugly situation.

""From my omugwo domain, I learnt that many have fallen sick without any kobo to seek medical services. The situation is as bad as that. Let me stop here so far as we wait for a fast positive response and reaction from His Excellency.”
 
 
 But in a letter dated May 8 and signed by one Osuchukwu S.O for the Acting Director-General of IBC, the government said Ottih’s action was ridiculous with the sole aim of sabotaging the government. The letter reads, “I am directed to issue a query to you for granting a press conference without approval from the government (being a public servant) where you informed the world that government was unable to pay your salaries. “I am also directed to let you know that this attitude caused serious embarrassment to the Imo State Government, thereby ridiculing the government in the eyes of the public with the sole aim of sabotaging the government. “Therefore, based on the above, I am directed to ask you to explain within 24 hours on receipt of this letter why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for ridiculing and sabotaging the government.” 
 
 When contacted, General Manager of the corporation said he wasn’t in the position to speak on the matter. “I’m not capable of giving you the answer, please leave me alone or contact the Honourable Commissioner for Information,” he said. In an indication that the matter is yet to be resolved, Ottih in a Facebook on May 9, 2020, said that, “You would have gone ahead with your immediate sack letter.

",/2020/05/14/nigerias-school-feeding-programme-during-covid-19-ploy-steal-n135bn-%E2%80%94pdp,"The People’s Democratic Party has accused the Nigerian Government of planning to steal N13.5bn while disguising the plan as feeding school children during COVID-19 pandemic. Kola Olognondiyan, PDP spokesperson, in a statement, questioned the rationale behind feeding school children while schools were indefinitely shut due to Coronavirus outbreak. The statement reads in part, “While it is clear that the APC-led administration’s school feeding programme had always been a scam, the claim to feed school children even when schools are closed is a colossal racketeering taken too far. “This goes to further expose that stealing and corruption are deeply engrained in the DNA of the APC and its administration. 
 
 “While the PDP has nothing against any transparent effort to provide succour to Nigerians, particularly our children, at this critical time, our party rejects the on-going fraud in which school children, who are in their respective homes, bearing the brunt of the failures of the APC administration, are being used as metaphors to divert public funds to a few corrupt individuals in the Buhari Presidency. “Nigerians are witnesses to how the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Umar Farouq, had always stammered, makes conflicting pronouncements and points to Mr President’s speech as a cover each time Nigerians demand for details of her humongous spendings. “The minister had failed to provide details of how she intends to reach the 9.7 million school children, who are now in their homes in different locations since the closure of schools, even as officials continue to muddle up required documentations in a bid to cover their tracks. “Nigerians are invited to note how the minister contradicted herself in claiming that the food would be shared door-to door and in the same breath, averred that vouchers would be allocated at specific collection times to avoid overcrowding. “Such contradiction only betrays an unwholesome tendency, as Nigerians wonder how there would be overcrowding on door-to-door distribution of food to children who are claimed to have been individually designated in various locations. “If these officials indeed mean well for the school children, they should hand over the funds to the ministry of education in the respective states for appropriate dispensation to properly identified and documented vulnerable children.”"

Further revelations concerning the fund came to the fore at plenary on Thursday when Chairman, House Committee on Public Acounts, Honourable Edamisan Ademola, reeled out the list of banks at various times that benefitted from the alleged secret transactions. Edamisan challenged the competence of the Accountant-General for failing to produce necessary documents bearing the transactions and the accrued interest to date. 
 
 He maintained that if the statements of financial transactions in the listed banks were not supplied as requested, the House would be forced to take necessary steps as entrenched in the constitution. Among other details, the House sought to know the source of the fund, the date the money was lodged into the alleged secret account, the person who authorised the lodging and the accrued interest to date. The House equally wanted to know how the money, which members claimed was not appropriated was spent. Responding, the Commissioner for Finance, Mr Wale Akinterinwa, pledged to provide the necessary documents as requested by the House. In his ruling, the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon Oleyelogun Bamidele David, mandated the commissioner and the Accountant General to furnish the House with documents on the alleged secret transactions on Thursday 21st May, 2020. The Finance Commissioner claimed he facilitated the recovery of the money kept in a secret account over 10 years ago. The House has vowed to get to the root of the secret transactions in the interest of transparency and accountability, as elected representatives of the people.

Adibe also advised Nigerians not to expect too much from the newly appointed Chief of Staff to President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari. He spoke in an interview with Channels Television monitored by SaharaReporters. 
 
 Adibe said since Gambari would only serve in an advisory role, he would not rule over others as an emperor nor has the capacity to wield much influence. He said, “Professor Gambari is not going to solve the problem of cabals in government. In political science, we have what we call the iron law of oligarchy, that any organisation, no matter how democratic they may have started, precisely because authorities would have to be delegated, there would be competition in various centres of power to capture access or to exercise disproportionate influence. “We should be careful not to expect too much from him. The President has a team of economic advisers; so his job is only to advise.” Adibe, however, harped on the possibility that Gambari might join the cabal sooner than expected.
 
 “So, a small clique will always become triumphant, which means that anytime you talk about government, you talk about the struggle for state capture, you talk about cabal. Everyone will be a cabal, sooner than later, he will become part of the cabal that…he would have to exercise disproportionate influence,” he said. He added, “He looks at some of the proposals that are being presented to the president and narrow down the options. Sometimes, he doesn’t do this alone, he has his own staff. He can use consultants and then be able to advise the president. “I think he is also in a position to tell the president the bitter truth in a nice way that the president will not feel bad about. We should disabuse our mind that the chief of staff will run the government as a king.”"

The PDP said it was impossible to have free and fair elections in Nigeria today with the way the electoral process was set up. 
 
 He said, ""We are concened about the electoral process in itself. Until and unless electoral reforms are carried out, to manage the situation in which we have found ourselves electorally, our party does not believe that we can have a free, fair and credible election ""Just before the 2019 election, the National Assembly submitted an amendment to Mr President to address the fault lines in our electoral process which he has refused to sign. ""For instance, in the last election in Kogi State, voter registers were not displayed. We could not ascertain those who actually participated in that election, whether the dead or the living. Going into the upcoming elections, INEC is saying it cannot display the voters register which is the cardinal programme in electioneering.

The PDP noted that if the lawmakers of the state's Assembly had not issued a query on the money, the Governor Rotimi Akeredolu-led government would have been silent on the discovery of the secret account and the withdrawals. 
 
 In a statement on Friday, spokesperson for the PDP, Mr Zadok Akintoye, said it was also worrisome that the state government never disclosed the said funds as part of money handed over to it by the previous government.  He said, ""Investigation by our party has shown that the Akeredolu-led ODSG is being economical with the truth and has violated the law with its intentions not to disclose the receipt of such funds until it was recently probed by the Ondo State House of Assembly. 
 
 ""For the records, the Commissioner for Information lied when he alleged that the ODSG discovered the funds hidden in an account with the bank.  ""The domiciled funds which was deposited in a call account was disclosed to the Akeredolu-led government which consequently took over the bank account. What is however, worrisome is that the Ondo State Government never disclosed the said funds as part of the funds handed over to it as part of the assets its inherited.  ""We must therefore ask how this fund was accounted for or captured in the records of government.""

Wike had earlier on Sunday demolished Prodest Hotel, Alode in Eleme, and Etemeteh Hotel in Onne for allegedly violating the executive order he put in place to stop the spread of Coronavirus.  Rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said the demolition was illegal going by the provisions of the constitution. 
 
 He said, ""It is totally unconscionable and the very foundation of what he has done is flawed. There is no governor in Nigeria that can use executive order to perform a judicial function. ""Even if there was an executive order that states in black and white expressly that any hotel or hotel owner whose facility shall be demolished, it will be unconstitutional because whether the person has actually committed an infraction can only be determined by a court of law. So, even if the governor actually goes to the hotel and find a guest lodging, it is not in his place to determine if that amounts to an offence, the owner of the hotel has to be subjected to the judicial process. ""So, for a governor in Nigeria to claim that he has the authority to demolish the probate property of citizens without recourse to the court is illegal.  ""The right to own immovable property is guaranteed under the constitution, the right to acquire and own property, it cannot be derrogated from. ""Beyond the legality of the action, what the governor has done is reprehensible and is the action of a reprobate mind, it is psychopathic. How do you demolish a building because it flours an order? That building creates employment."" Effiong also revealed that the punishment for violating an executive order is N200 or six months in a correctional center and wondered why the provisions of the law was not adhered to in the matter. He added, ""The punishment for violating any executive order according to the constitution made pursuant to the Quarantine Act is six months imprisonment or a fine of N200, the law is very clear.""  PHOTONEWS: Few Days After Demolishing Hotels For Violating COVID-19 Lockdown Order,   Attends Rivers State PDP Inauguration Where Social Distancing Guideline Was Violated  Public interest lawyer, Jiti Ogunye, on Friday told SaharaReporters that the accused in the matter were never charged to court or given the opportunity for defence as stipulated by the constitution, rendering Governor Wike's action illegal. He said, ""What was done is arbitrary and amounts to executive lawlessness. The law is clear, Section 36 of the constitution guarantees the right to fair hearing and it also provides that no one can be punished except in accordance to a written law that must have been violated and the alleged offender would be afforded the opportunity to defend himself before a court of law or tribunal. ""This guarantees impartiality and fairness. The executive branch of government cannot be the accuser, the investigator of the alleged offence, the prosecutor, the judge, and the punishment executioner all rolled into one. ""And we are not even talking about the executive inelegance of personally supervising the demolition of a property that was operated allegedly in violation of the COVID-19 regulation according to the governor of Rivers State. ""What made the property fit for demolition? Is it that the land on which the property is built does not belong to the owner or that the property built was in violation of environmental laws? Why would a physical structure be targeted for demolition if the human beings who allegedly violated the regulation are available to be punished in accordance with the law?""  "

Awara said: “Nenye Kocha is not the collation agent of AAC in INEC office, Port Harcourt. Dr. Chuku is the duly-nominated collation agent of AAC, but he was prevented by security personnel at the gate of INEC’s office in Port Harcourt from moving to the collation centre. “I have the unit by unit results of the March 9, 2019 elections in Rivers State.

As at the time the collation was suspended, I had 281,000 votes, as against Wike’s 79,000 votes. So, they (INEC officials) quickly came to his rescue. “We have written a petition on the electoral fraud in Rivers State to the INEC chairman, stating the actual results, but Professor Yakubu will not take action.” He urged his supporters to remain calm stating that the result would be challenged and he would “reclaim the stolen mandate”. “I want Rivers people to be calm. We are going to reclaim the stolen mandate. We should not be troubled and we should never opt for violence. “I want Rivers people, especially my teeming supporters, who are being pained by what they are seeing, to keep hope alive.

It was learnt that the money in the account was fixed in Zenith Bank, Alagbaka, Akure branch in the state capital. 
 
 SaharaReporters gathered that some transactions were carried out on the account through transfer into other accounts in different banks, which belongs to the state government for the purpose of yielding huge interest.  In another document seen by SaharaReporters, the state's Account-General, Mr Akindolire; Director of Treasury Service, Mr Akinsanmi, and Director of Management Services, Akinnagbe, signed the memo to transfer the recovered money from Zenith Bank to three other banks. The state government, it was discovered, secretly transferred funds to its expenditure accounts and dedicated reserve accounts using the auto pay platform. The other banks where money from the 'secret' account was transferred into include Providus Bank (Account:  , N1bn), Zenith Bank (Account:  , N1bn, N300,000, 000, N600,000,000, and N100,000, 000), Wema Bank (Account:  , N2bn), First Bank (Account:  , N250,000,000).  by   on Scribd The discovery of the 'secret' account  was made public by members of the House of Assembly Committee on Public Accounts, who raised the issue on the floor of the parliament following a probe. One of the lawmakers, who spoke with SaharaReporters under the condition of anonymity on Friday, said the government had been hiding the statements of the financial transactions on the bank account. According to him, the lawmakers had already invited the state's Account-General over the matter with a view to knowing the real source of the funds and the exact date the money was lodged in the 'secret' account including the interest that had generated from it in the last 10 years. He said, “They are telling us the money in the account was discovered around February or March 2018 and they failed to disclosed the account then, is that not corruption? “In fact, from our findings it showed that they were running the account even after its discovery, so who were these people running the account for the state government and collecting the interest. “And now they are claiming the money had been spent to pay salaries or execute some projects in the state, so we all need to know how they spent it because I am yet to see where it was appropriated.” 
 
 The Ondo State Government had on Wednesday said that the account was uncovered through the vigilance of the state's Commissioner for Finance, Wale Akinterinwa, a position rejected by the lawmakers. Commissioner for Information in the state, Donald Ojogo, claimed that the money in the account had been ploughed into the revenue account of government and reflected in the records of the state.

On the main reason for his visit, President Embalo said having stabilised his country after the tussle that attended the general elections won by him, he had come to seek counsel from Buhari on his plan for a government of national unity and a proposed war against corruption in his country. “Problems of Guinea Bissau are problems of Nigeria. I have come to you as your son. I need your help and assistance to make the people happy. I will not let you down, neither will I put you in any difficult situation,” the visiting leader told President Buhari. In response to these demands, Buhari commended Embalo on his confirmation as President and for stabilising the country. “I commend your political dexterity in getting the opposition to join the proposed unity government,” he said.  "

Entertainment,Brymo: The Preacher Without A Church,"1 Year Ago
",/2018/09/23/brymo-preacher-without-church,"
 
 In 1998, Fela’s album titled ‘Music is the weapon of the future’ was released. For many reasons, the title of the album read varying meanings for different people. Twenty years down the line, Flash forward to 2018, twenty years later, music has not only become the 'weapon', it is now more or less the must-have ‘weapon’ of many people. To the left, a little child is being driven to sleep by a lullaby from a doll; to the right, a depressed man is being taught how to smile again by the lyrics of a soulful music; downtown, a hustler’s dream is being fuelled by the beats from fast-track music. And in the ivory towers, the beauty of wealth is celebrated with royalty music. Music not just only a weapon, it has now become a culture. Olawale Ashimi, more popularly known as Brymo, is one man who has grown from that commercial artist trying to score a hit so the heavy money-pumping brands won’t run to another artist, to that artist whose voice, melody and rhyme finds its way to the loneliest and deepest part of emotions. He is one of the very few whose music would make many listeners take a pen and jotter to write down the words of wisdom coming from his songs. He did not just jump out of the blues into the music space; he had to journey through some burning flames to become who he is today. Born on May 9, 1986 in Okokomaiko, a suburb in Lagos, to an Awori carpenter and an Egun trader, Olawale Ashimi, who loves to be called Olawale Olofo’ro, better known as Brymo started making music in secondary school in 1999. The Lagos State University drop-out released his first song which he titled ‘Future’. Growing up as the neighbourhood ‘wahala pikin’, Brymo initially had dreams of playing football but had wake up from that when he listened to his mother sing fuji, and he was inspired to make music. After dropping his football dream for music, in 2002, he and some of his friends came together to form a musical group called ‘The Aliens’. However, after struggling with some issues in 2004 and 2005, the group parted ways. And with this, Brymo became a solo artist. Eight years after dropping his first song, in 2007, Brymo dropped his debut album ‘Brymstone’. Upon release of the album, according to him he sold 2,000 copies within the first six months and the album got him a marketing deal of N1 million, which did not work out. If Brymo decides to write a biography tomorrow, one page that won’t be missing from his story is his journey through the four walls of Chocolate City, the record label that brought him from obscurity to spotlight after he signed a record deal with the label in 2010. After blessing Ice Prince with vocals to his hit single ‘Oleku’, on September 18, 2011 Brymo released his second album lead single ‘Ara’ which was produced by Legendary Beats. His sophomore album ‘The Son of A Carpenter’ was released on November 23, 2012 with features from Jesse Jagz, Pryse, M.I. and Ice Prince. Speaking on the album, Brymo said inspiration for the album came as a result of his father’s occupation as a carpenter. Speaking in an interview with omojuwa,com, he said: “I titled it so, because my father is a carpenter. I was only trying to tell my story and pass a message that irrespective of our backgrounds, we can always be whatever we want to be. I was one of those kids who used to think my parents did not do enough. When I was younger, I was ashamed of my background but thank God, today, I am proud of my parents. I’m proud of Okokomaiko, the neighbourhood, where I grew up and I am proud of my achievements.” However, while fans were still savouring the album, the singer announced via twitter that he had left Chocolate City just after one month Jesse Jagz, a fellow singer, left. When the news first broke, the record label denied the news saying the singer still had three years left on his contract. Speaking on Brymo’s leaving, Audu Makori, the President of Chocolate City, told Premium Times that “It’s a very clear case of breach of contract and it is in court. If an artiste feels that he is aggrieved, even within the contract, there is a mechanism to resolve issues. When you fail to honour your contract and you abandon it feeling that you have a right, the contract empowers you to go to court and that’s what has happened.” “We had a discussion at Chocolate City’s office in Lekki in December 2012, when he told me I can leave the label. I was not happy with the way I was being treated by the label and we agreed to stop working together. He was to give me a document to that effect but he later changed his mind,” Brymo told the court in 2014. Brymo would later tell Toolz in an interview in 2016 that the label and him “had the opportunity to iron it out in court but they fried it up. I don’t know what they did but they definitely spoke to the judge and spoke to the lawyers and scrapped the case. They are lawyers; they can do it”. With what happened, one’s best prediction would have been that the end of the son of carpenter’s musical career was probably in sight. However, he has not disappointed the world by going into oblivion as per expectations. He remained strong honing his craft and went on to subsequently drop an album. ‘Tabularasa’, an 11-track album was released on October 30, 2014 after his controversial split with his former record label. According to the singer, he got the title for the album after he heard the judge handling his case against his label use it. The album contains tracks like ‘1 Pound’; ‘Je’le O Sinmi’ and ‘Prick No Get shoulder’. The album contains a detailed explanation of the singer’s troubles, joys and the shape his art would take in the nearest future. Songs like ‘Dear Child’ tells children the dangers of being impatient and anxious. The lyrics to the song read: “Grandma was a very good old lady. She tried and died working to feed her grown babies. From dusk to dawn, she laboured for more. Nothing was okay. Nothing was ever enough. She say time go heal everything, because time go kill everything. She said a lifetime is enough time; Say if you take time you go fit to make time.” Not done yet, the following year, he released an eight-track album which he titled ‘Trance’. The album was released by American record label, Tate Music Group. According to Brymo, the album is a “a medley of thoughts based on his experiences”. On May 9, 2016, the now refined Brymo draped his fifth studio album ‘Klitoris’. Esse Kakada, Brymo’s girlfriend, was the only feature on the album. Explaining the reason behind the title, the artiste said: “The album is the key to a certain door I have knocked on for years; and yes it was meant to be sensual. There ought to be two sides to the coin"". And then in 2018, the singer released his sixth studio album, which he titled ‘Oso’, a Yoruba word which mean ‘The Wizard’. The album received critical acclaim. A single off the album, ‘Banuso’ is Brymo’s latest musical project which touches on the importance of “communing with one’s heartland not with mere men”.  The video, which was brilliantly directed by Victor Adewale, a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University showed Brymo embracing minimalism by being the only feature in the video. Brymo — the wizard as he chooses to call himself — has now become the prophet many people seek for advice, because his melody and lyrics bring peace to troubled souls. Brymo is the preacher without a church with a spice of philosophy. His music stands tall in the confines of providing therapy."
Politics,"Group Accuses President Buhari Of Nepotism, Breach Of Federal Character In Composition Of Police Trust Fund Board","23 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/16/group-accuses-president-buhari-nepotism-breach-federal-character-composition-police-trust,"A group, Campaign for Equity, has faulted the membership of the Board of Trustees of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, which was announced by President Muhammadu Buhari on May 6. The group in a statement by its National Coordinator, Oliver Akosa, said the pattern of appointments by the President did not reflect federal character and the diversity of the country. According to Akosa, the Chairman of the board, Suleiman Abbah, and Executive Secretary, Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, were both from the North-West of the country.  Also, two other members of the eight-man team, Mansur Ahmed and Usman Bilkisu, are from Kano and Kebbi states respectively in the same region. 
 
 Akosa said the group was concerned that with this arrangement, the entire police architecture was dangerously tilted in favour of one zone of the country as the Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, was as well from the North-West. The statement reads, ""While we applaud the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for taking steps to ensure that the Nigeria Police Force is well funded, well equipped and highly professional in line with international best practices, we note with disappointment that the composition of the Board of Trustees of the Fund is sectional, parochial and lopsided and does not therefore meet the basic requirements of federal character as enshrined in the constitution of the  Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). ""Suleiman Abbah, Chairman of the board, is from Jigawa State in North-West Nigeria. The Executive Secretary, Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto, hails from Sokoto State in the same North-West. It is clearly odd and obscene for a national agency which is supposed to reflect the country's geopolitics, have its chairman and secretary coming from one zone of the country. ""As if this is not embarrassing enough, two other members of the eight-man arrangement come from the same North-West. Mansur Ahmed, the member representing Organised Labour and Usman Bilkisu, the member representing Ministry of Justice, are from Kano and Kebbi states respectively. To cap it all, the Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, is from Sokoto in the same North-West. ""From the foregoing, it can be safely concluded that the entire police leadership of the country is in the hands of the North-West. This arrangement falls short of both regional and federal balance. ""We believe that these salient facts may have escaped those who constituted the Board of Trustees of the PTF. Consequently, we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to reconstitute the Board of the PTF. In doing so, he should be conscious of regional or geopolitical balance.""  "

The award was presented at the Foreign Investment Network (FIN) and Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources Honorary Patrons Dinner and Awards Night, which held at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit, Abuja on Monday. The award was presented as an “acknowledgement of Peters’ significant contribution to the oil and gas development in Africa, his visionary leadership, distinguished service and transformational disruption of a sector dominated by international oil companies”. The award also acknowledged that “Aiteo Group’s 20-year evolution through Africa’s oil and gas sector has been exemplary as well as revolutionary — going from a downstream start-up to becoming a leading integrated energy conglomerate with strategic investments in hydrocarbon (or commodities) exploration and production. Speaking at the award ceremony, Michael Dragoyevich, Chief Executive Officer of FIN, said: “Mr Peters has earned a unique honour to stand out among his peers as winner of the coveted FIN African Icon of the Year Award.” Dedicating the award to all Aiteo employees worldwide, Peters said: “The award by FIN as its African Icon of the Year is awe-inspiring. It’s an honour to receive this type of recognition. Our modest efforts to provide Africa’s market places with top-quality energy solutions while being a reference point for indigenous capacity in oil and gas have clearly paid off, and we are proud of the fact that we continue to receive such prestigious distinction.” Peters ventured into the oil and gas sector as an entrepreneur in 1999 and initially traded mainly in the downstream sector. In 2015, his company, Aiteo won the bid for the largest onshore oil block in sub-Saharan Africa.  Beyond oil, Peter’s group has investments in mining, agriculture, infrastructure development, electricity generation and distribution,  with a fast-developing retail distribution network.   "
Lifestyle,"NGOs, Catholic Women Partner To Tackle The LGBT Threat To African Family Values","1 Year Ago
",/2019/02/12/ngos-catholic-women-partner-tackle-lgbt-threat-african-family-values,"Nigeria is said to have a 'youth bulge', with over 6O per cent of its population between ages 15 and 35 years. This implies that the country has huge human resources, which, if properly harnessed, are capable of restoring its pride of place among the comity of nations. Unfortunately, young people are confronted with various challenges that continually hinder them from reaching their maximum potential. These include increased rate of drug abuse and addiction, pornography, prostitution, unemployment, promiscuity, eroding societal values among other issues have left a good number of youths devastated. These have made it imperative for the Foundation for African Cultural Heritage (FACH), a Non-profit Governmental Organisation (NGO), to collaborate with the Catholic Women Organisation (CWO) in changing the narrative by sensitising, informing and guarding the youth against external influences from some international organisations, most especially those that promulgate LGBT agenda in contradiction of the African Cultural and religious beliefs, thereby contributing to the collapse of family values.   Through a two-day conference tagged 'Responding to the Challenges of Youth, family and society: The Millennial's Response', various speakers drawn from within and outside the country, including Catholic Bishops of Enugu, Awka and Nsukka, urged parents to embrace the challenge of training their children in line with the principles of the church, as bad parenting and neglect is bedevilling the future of young people.  President, Catholic Women Organisation, Nigeria, Barrister Nwanneka Okolo; President, World Youth Alliance, Anna Halpine and Director, Quality Assurance And Research Development Agency, Dr Tessy Okafor, raised concerns about teaching ""comprehensive sexuality education"" in primary and secondary schools, which they say exposes children to the use of contraceptives at an early age. They warned that bizarre and wrong sexual orientation encourages abuse of their sexuality and in the long run are harmful to the development of the children, thereby promoting LGBT agenda alien to African culture. The conference exposed participants to tactics employed by these International Donor Agencies in funding distribution contraceptives and condoms in schools and among young people. Examples of how they penetrate lawmaking arm of government were cited during the conference.  Legislators in the country were advised to be on the alert and acquire adequate knowledge on the terminologies and words that suggest LGBT rights, as found in some bills brought before national and state assemblies. Other pro-life advocates, including directors of FACH, Dr Nkechi Asogwa, Dr Regina Akosa and member Mrs Ifeyinwa Agwu, among others, highlighted the importance of upholding ""human dignity"", which they described as the basis for ""human rights"". Participants were enlightened by experts on health and psychological problems associated with using contraceptives for family planning and IVF. They were encouraged to embrace and spread the message of natural and safe methods of conception and child spacing to safeguard the health of African women. These international organisations were urged to assist the country in fixing its infrastructural deficit as against funding initiatives detrimental to population growth and maternal health. Despite the misconceptions by today's society about abstinence, which is often considered archaic, youth are being advised at the to embrace chastity as the pathway to happy marriage. Youths were also encouraged to imbibe virtues that will strengthen their personalities and self-confidence such as volunteering. They were told to implore the effective and active use of social media to promote values and evangelise the message of Christ."

",/2019/04/07/nigerians-marry-late-because-its-difficult-them-find-right-partners-says-expert,"Mope Ogunlusi, a relationship expert and marriage counsellor, has said Nigerians marry late because finding the right partner is usually difficult for them. Ogunlusi, who has been a counsellor and matchmaker for 15 years, disclosed this on Saturday in Osogbo in an interview with NAN. She also attributed late marriages to issues of genotype compatibility, financial status and parental influence on who a child should marry. She said: “A lot of Nigerians are still single and unmarried despite reaching the marriageable age bracket because they often times find it difficult to find the right partners. “The act of searching for a partner with the right genotype and looking for a financially capable partner are creating problems for singles in selecting a partner and often times eliminating the feeling of love. “Sometimes, people fall in love just to find out that their genotypes are not compatible and this often times lead to searching all over for a new partner, often times leading to frustration if the same incompatibility keeps re-occurring.” According to Ogunlusi, a lot of Nigerian singles now have little or no time to socialise and search for a life partner because of the financial pressure they face on daily basis. “The need for financial security and meeting daily needs has created a routine life style for a lot of people and finding time to socialise has become difficult because of the time invested in searching for daily needs,"" she said. In addition to the financial security challenges individuals face, she said some ladies and men are too choosy in selecting their partners based on his or her financial position and status. She said the trend of looking for rich men or ladies to marry is creating a corrupt cycle that has affected marriage as a sacred institution ordained by God. She added that some parents set standards for their children on who to marry, which adds to the problem. ""Some parents usually set specification of the kind of man or woman their children can marry in terms of looks, tribe, ethnicity, educational qualification and finance,"" she said, commending, however, the efforts of matchmaking outfits in trying to help eliminate these problems created by social ills and nature, by creating a platform for singles to meet and have their dream marriages come true."

 In the bid to reduce the number of sickle cell patients in the state, the Anambra State House of Assembly has passed a bill that makes genotype test compulsory before marriage. The bill, which was sponsored by Charles Ezeani, member representing Anaocha II constituency and 15 others, was passed on Tuesday. The new law also seeks to reduce abuse, stigmatisation and exploitation victims of sickle cell anaemia go through in the state. The new law states that parents and guardians should not give out their children in marriage until a genotype test is carried out. According to the law, no religious body or marriage registry “shall perform solemnisation of Holy Matrimony”, without presentation of a sickle cell disease prevention certificate from the intending couple. As punishment, parents, guardians, as well as priests, pastors and marriage registries that perform the marriage without genotype test, risk going to jail. “Anybody who contravenes the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N200,000 or imprisonment to a term of three years or both,"" the law states. Speaking after the passage of the bill, Ezeani said that love is blind but the new law would ensure that lives are saved, and unnecessary death prevented.  "

   An Abuja High Court has fixed February 20 for ruling on an application to join Nigeria Football Federation President, Amaju Pinnick, and Secretary-General, Mohammed Sanusi, in the alleged misappropriation of $9.5m FIFA grant. Justice Peter Affen had earlier fixed October 22, 2019 for ruling in the application before the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation said it wanted to harmonise all cases involving the alleged fraud. However, at the resumed hearing on Monday, Abubakar Musa, Senior State Counsel from the Federation Ministry of Justice, told the court that the AGF was withdrawing the application for harmonisation to enable Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to go on with the matter. EFCC had arraigned three officials of NFF before the court in an alleged $9.5m FIFA grant misappropriation before applying on April 30 to join both Pinnick and Sanusi in the matter as co-defendants. Those being tried earlier were Christopher Andekin, NFF Director of Administration and Finance; Reagan Zaka, Cashier, and Fadanari Mamza, Head, Finance and Account Department. The EFCC charged the defendants with five counts bordering on criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and misappropriation. The EFCC alleged that they conspired between January 8 and 26, 2015 to commit the offense, contrary to Section 97 of Penal Code. Andekin was alleged to have been entrusted with money meant for the development of football in Nigeria, a grant from world football body, the Federation of International Football Association. He was alleged to have fraudulently diverted $1.3m from the NFF domiciliary account with Zenith Bank, an act that is contrary to Section 311 of the Penal Code. Zaka, on his part, was said to have fraudulently diverted $7.2m from the FIFA grant, while Mamza was alleged to have diverting $2.3m.  "
POETRY,"Peddlers Of Fake News Are Cowards, Says Soyinka","1 Year Ago
",/2019/01/10/peddlers-fake-news-are-cowards-says-soyinka,"
 
 Wole Soyinka, Nigeria’s only Nobel Laureate, says those who spread fake news are cowards and may need psychiatric evaluation. He also directed what appeared to be criticism at Obasanjo's support for Atiku's candidature. The literary icon spoke during a symposium in Abuja, on Wednesday, but did not directly mention neither Obasanjo nor Atiku, in his speech. He questioned the former president's change of heart, which seemed to refer to Obasanjo's initial stance on his former vice-president. His words: “We have got to develop very healthy scepticism. If someone in a position of power for eight years, has lectured a nation for eight years and after that continued year after year to continue to direct the minds of a whole nation in one direction only saying ‘this is Lucifer from hell’, for eight years in office and several more years out of office saying this is Lucifer and then one day he changed his left hand and says behold your redeemer, which of the two is fake news?” Obasanjo had heavily criticized Atiku, who was his vice, during his eight years of presidency.  In his book titled ‘My Watch’, Obasanjo described Atiku as a “shameless liar”.  At a time, Obasanjo said God would never forgive him if he supports Atiku. However, he took a different turn in 2018 when he endorsed the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar. Speaking further at the symposium, which was themed ‘Nigeria 2019: Countering Fake News', Soyinka advised that psychiatrists be involved in the advocacy against fake news. He reasoned that peddlers of fake news have mental problems. He went on to share his experience on how fake news has affected him, saying he had heard of news of his own death numerous times and laughable statements which never originated from him had been circulated as his.  He continued: ""During the last presidency, there was a statement attributed to me that I said that it serves President Jonathan right for marrying an illiterate woman. I never made any comment whatsoever about her and suddenly here it is staring me in the face. “An account (on Facebook) has even been created in my name and from time to time a card is sent to me and it reads, ‘Wole Soyinka says anyone who votes for this person must be stupid, must be mentally retarded, his mother must be a goat and his father must be a gorilla.’ “And this comes on all the time and I don’t want to understate the numerous motivations going into this. Although basically, I think the commonality is that those who create fake news are sick in the head and they are also cowards because they lack the conviction for their own beliefs and so they try to attribute to other people what they are thinking.” “I have insisted that it is something that must be treated criminally but I don’t want this to become an opportunity for our very bloodthirsty legislators to push the kind of law which they tried to enact the other time which they were decreeing capital punishment for any hate speech. “I don’t know how far it has gone, whether they have dropped it or if it is on the president's table but nothing I say today should be taken as an endorsement of that lunacy. “If people are bloodthirsty they should go and join Boko Haram instead of using the legislative chambers to initiate another opportunity for slaughtering people for speaking their minds like Khashoggi. Let us be very careful about that.” He advised that social media platforms like Facebook should put in more efforts in curtailing fake news. He also called on the need for INTERPOL and other global law enforcement agencies to join hand in the war against fake news. Soyinka also took out time to comment on the leaked audio of Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation.   “Just two or three days ago, I read an item where a minister was supposed to have insulted the president and it was carried in some media and I checked the statement and of course there was a video and so on and I looked through it, I read the text again and again and I said I have to relearn English language because I didn’t see where the insults were. “So sometimes, print media feels compelled to compete with the electronic  media and this is a great mistake because there is a reputation, there is an expectation and you should not be embarrassed to show yourself superior to a medium which is accessible to the lowest, the very dregs of society.”"

 Former Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has joined Manchester United on a six-month loan deal, becoming the first Nigerian to team up with the English Premier League side. Ighalo was signed from Chinese Super League club, Shanghai Shenhua, to provide attacking options for Manchester United, who are without injured attacker, Marcus Rashford, and have had troubles hitting in goals needed to boost their chances of qualifying for Europe next season. The 30-year-old Nigerian striker is the second senior addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad after the signing of Portuguese midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, from Sporting Lisbon. Ighalo scored 33 goals in 82 games for Watford during his first stint in the English topflight football league before moving to China in 2017.  The attacker has 16 goals to his credits out of 35 games played for the Super Eagles. "

 Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has warned that the decision to move the African Cup of Nations back to January by the Confederation of African Football will have an impact on the club's transfer policy. The AFCON will take place next winter in the middle of the English Premier League season, even though the last one took place in the summer. With Liverpool set to lose players like Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Naby Keita for up to six weeks, Klopp warned that the move will make club think twice about buying African players in the future. He said, “I couldn't respect the African Cup of Nations more than I do because I like the competition. “But it is an obvious problem that you play a tournament in the middle of the season. African Cup of Nations going back to January is, for us, a catastrophe. “It doesn't help African players. We will not sell Sadio, Mo or Naby just because they have a tournament in January and February – of course not – but if you have to make a decision about bringing in a player, it is a massive one because before the season you know for four weeks you don't have them. “That's a normal process and as a club you have to think about these things. It doesn't help the players, for sure.  “But these decisions are made without asking the players, without asking the managers, without asking anyone. It is just a decision.”"

 Andy Ruiz Jnr has parted ways with his trainer, Manny Robles, following his rematch loss to Anthony Joshua. The Mexican was outclassed by the British heavyweight in Saudi Arabia in December as he lost via a unanimous decision, gifting his titles back to Joshua after a stunning upset last summer. Ruiz stopped Joshua in Madison Square Garden last June to claim the IBF, IBO, WBA Super and WBO belts, but he admitted to overeating and partying in the aftermath of his historic win, and Robles said the split was inevitable.  Speaking to ESPN, Robles said Ruiz had been out of control in the build up to the crucial rematch, with the man himself admitting he 'wished he had taken it more seriously'. But he added that the relationship was never going to work going forward because Ruiz 'wasn't listening'. He said, “I've seen it coming, I'll be honest with you. Andy was just doing whatever he wanted to do. The dad, obviously with him being the manager, he just had no control over his son. None of us had control of him for that matter. “Fortunately for me, Andy took the blame on himself and didn't sit there like a majority of fighters and blame the coach.” Speaking after his one-sided loss to Joshua, Ruiz said his emotional victory over his rival last year had put him on cloud nine and took celebrations a little too far. He said, “I was having too much fun, I was celebrating too much. Even out of shape, even the way that I was training back and forth (between Mexico and California). I wish I had taken it more serious.” Ruiz will now be looking for a new coach for 2020 as he looks to put himself back on the heavyweight map.  "

 The Tokyo Marathon Foundation has cancelled the amateur Tokyo Marathon over fear of Coronavirus. According to AFP, the cancellation would affect about 38,000 runners, who had registered to participate at the event. “We reached the conclusion that unfortunately it is difficult to organise the event after several cases (of the virus) were confirmed in Tokyo,” the Tokyo Marathon Foundation said in a statement. The decision will not affect elite runners, including elite wheelchair participants, the organisers said. But they only account for around 200 of the tens of thousands of people, who had registered for the March 1 race. The cancellation comes after Japanese government officials warned the spread of the virus in the country entering “a new phase”. At least 65 cases have been diagnosed in Japan excluding hundreds of infections aboard a cruise ship quarantined off the coast. On Sunday, the health minister warned citizens to avoid large crowds and non-essential gatherings, sparking speculation that the marathon would be cancelled. A public gathering for the birthday of Emperor Naruhito that was scheduled for February 23 has also been cancelled over the virus fears."

 A row has broken out in Tanzania over the government's decision to impose a tax on wigs and hair extensions. Many male and some female MPs applauded and thumped their desks in approval when Finance Minister Philip Mpango announced the tax in parliament. Supporters of the levy say it will help women keep their hair natural. But there has also been public outrage, with women saying they are being punished for wanting to look good in wigs and hair extensions. Tanzanians tend to uphold traditional values, but society is changing and many women now wear wigs and extensions, the BBC's Aboubakar Famau reports from the capital, Dodoma. In his budget speech in parliament on Thursday, Mr. Mpango announced a 25% tax on imported wigs and hair extensions and a 10% tax on those made locally as part of a series of measures aimed at increasing government revenue. The cheapest wigs currently costs around $4 (£3.40), but they can sell for up to $130. Mr. Mpango also scrapped the exemption on value-added tax placed on sanitary towels, saying consumers had not benefited as businesses did not reduce prices when it was introduced"

Wilder was dominated by Fury as he suffered the first professional defeat of his career, being knocked down twice en route a stoppage defeat in the seventh round, according to Independent UK. It was the first knockdown, which saw Wilder sustain the injury that would eventually be the difference as Fury swung a right hook towards the back of his head, bouncing off the ear and possibly perforating the eardrum. Wilder was then dominated by body and head shots to which he had no real answer until his corner decided the fight could be no more and brought to a close towards the end of the seventh round.  Fury was then crowned WBC heavyweight champion before both men spoke graciously in the ring, as Wilder skipped the post-fight press conference and was taken immediately to hospital to be examined for possible ear injuries as well as a general observation."

In a statement issued on Saturday, Anwar said the government has concluded arrangements to conduct mass wedding for 1,500 prospective couples across the 44 Local Government Areas of the state. Anwar said the couples passed through different stages of screening before they got to the final wedding stage. He said N20,000 would be given by the state government as dowry for every bride, amounting to N30million. He said: “While dowry would be paid, it is also part of the magnanimous engagement by the state government that complete sets of beds, side mirrors, wardrobes and mattresses would all be provided for each couple. “A complete set of cushion chairs would also be given to each and every couple, which includes three-seater chairs and other side chairs. Window blinds and plastic carpets will also be provided. “New clothing materials, popularly called ‘Shadda’ would be provided for all the would-be husbands, so that they can appear as happily wedded grooms, showcasing their happiness to families, friends and well wishers."" Anwar said it was the hope of the government that what is provided for the couples would go a long way in serving as relief for them after the marriage.  In 2018, the state government set up a 23-member committee on state-sponsored mass wedding, under the leadership of Professor Sani Zaharaddeen."

 A Metropolitan Police officer, Khafi Kareem, is appearing on the Nigerian version of Big Brother despite being refused permission by her bosses and could face disciplinary action. Ms. Kareem, 29, who was pictured alongside Commissioner Cressida Dick as the Met celebrated 100 years of women in the force last November, is one of the stars of the African reality TV show. Scotland Yard said it had not granted Ms. Kareem’s request to appear on the programme and that an internal investigation would be carried out, reports UK Press Association. The UK Metropolitan Police said Ms. Kareem was granted unpaid leave for an “unrelated reason” ahead of appearing on the show but her request to take part in the programme was denied. A spokesman said: “A Pc, attached to the Met’s transformation command, requested permission to take part in a reality television entertainment show in Nigeria. Permission was not given. “The Met is aware that the officer has since appeared on the show without authority. “The Directorate of Professional Standards has been informed and will be carrying out an investigation into the circumstances. “The Met does not support the officer’s appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show.” The force added that any officer found to have breached police standards of professional behaviour could face misconduct proceedings. According to The Sun, Ms. Kareem joined the force as a Pc based at Lambeth station in 2015, having worked part-time as a special constable for four years. An unnamed colleague told the newspaper: “She’s a serving British police officer — it’s outrageous. She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway.” A post on the website of Africa Magic, the television channel which broadcasts Big Brother Naija, says Ms. Kareem joined the show “so that she can do societal good”. It read: “Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself. “She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good. “What people don’t know about her is that she is secretly talented in spoken word, singing, and dancing. She is an Ekiti native who resides in London.” The post also reveals Ms. Kareem would spend the prize money, reportedly worth N30 million (£68,000), on hosting a travel show in Nigeria, as well as investing in charitable causes."

 A British policewoman faces the sack for defying her bosses to appear a reality television programme - before appearing to sleep with a man on the show. PC Khafi Kareem, 29, from the Metropolitan Police, was warned not to take part in Nigerian Big Brother this year. But she was granted unpaid leave and entered the show, in which she has formed a relationship with fellow contestant Ekpata Gedoni, 31, the Sun reported. Audiences in Nigeria have been caught up in their liaisons, of which there has been three, but she will now be the subject of an investigation by the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards. And her colleagues have expressed their dismay at her 'tarnishing' the force's reputation with her antics. The officer was used as a 'poster girl' for the Met, posing alongside Met Commissioner Cressida Dick to encourage black and female recruitment and celebrate 100 years of women in the force. One colleague told the Sun: ""She's a serving British police officer - it's outrageous. She asked permission to go on the show but, when her request was refused, she went anyway. Her out-of-office email reply blatantly says that she is away from work, yet no one does anything. ""Other officers working with her are furious that she can just disobey orders then swan off Africa and tarnish the reputation of the force."" Ms. Kareem began as a PC at Lambeth station in 2015 after four years spent as a part-time special constable. The officer, who has spoken against stop-and-search, joined up after a 16-year-old friend was stabbed to death, UK Daily Mail reports. The PC worked as a spotter at airports, looking for possible victims of female genital mutilation (FGM). She also acted as a translator as she speaks French, Italian and her native Yoruba. However, she was moved from the FGM team after she argued with colleagues. Publicity material for the programme showed Miss Kareem in her uniform, branding her a talented singer and dancer. The material says of Miss Kareem: 'Police officer Khafi Kareem believes that you can have it all if you believe in yourself. 'She is not only hoping to win the prize money but she wants the exposure that being in Big Brother Naija House brings so that she can do societal good.' Her romance with Mr. Gedoni has been gripping viewers of the show, which began on June 30. Nigerian news websites published footage of the couple appearing to be in an act of congress beneath the sheets. One article said: ""There are now fears that Khafi may leave Big Brother Naija House pregnant as she and lovebird Gedoni continued their sizzling romance. The cameras caught them for the third time overnight as other housemates were dead asleep. The footage, now trending, showed the lovebirds moving their bodies in ecstasy under the sheets. Gedoni and Khafi first romped in the house on Saturday, July 20 and then again on Tuesday, July 23."" Her participation has left her fellow officers unimpressed. Another Met source told the Sun: ""There should be no way back for her from this and her superiors will have to act. ""She fitted the mould perfectly for how the modern force wants to portray itself but seems to have got a bit too big for her boots. 'It's hard to see how can she argue that she hasn't brought the force into disrepute.' A Met spokesman said last night: ""The Met does not support the officer's appearance nor does she represent the Met whilst appearing on the show. ""All officers have a duty to behave with professionalism and in a manner that does not bring the Met into disrepute whether on or off duty. ""Those who do not behave professionally risk breaching police standards of professional behaviour, and may be dealt with by way of misconduct proceedings."""

Bobrisky’s birthday venue was sealed off on Saturday when policemen laid siege to it. SaharaReporters reports that Nigerians on social media were divided on the legality of the police’s action. While some criticized the police for violating Bobrisky’s right to assemble, others thought Okuneye’s action was immoral. But, the pronoun to use in describing Bobrisky's gender generated a debate online. Bisi Alimi, a gay man and advocate for the LGBTQ rights cautioned that the right pronoun for Bobrisky is 'she' and 'her'. “Dear #Nigeria allies, the correct pronoun for #Bobrisky is “She/Her”.

Recall that the police in Lagos on Saturday shut a venue where a lavish birthday party was to be held for Bobrisky. Bobrisky, who clocked 28 on Saturday, had slated the celebration for two locations in Lagos with one to hold and another for Sunday.   The event was supposed to have held at Pearls Gardens in Lekki Phase 1 and Paradise Boat Club, Victoria Island. The incident came shortly after Director-General of the Nigerian Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Segun Runsewe, warned Bobrisky to desist from engaging in acts that runs rubbishes Nigeria’s rich culture.

 The National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) and the Nigerian government have condemned the sexual content on Big Brother Naija (BBN), a reality TV show, stating that it is not a Nigerian culture. Segun Runsewe, Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), said this while receiving Gloria Shoda, President of the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS). The NCAC boss also revealed that the government was in talks with Startimes to start a state-owned BBN that will truly reflect Nigerian content. He also warned that the agency would present a nudity bill to punish sexual acts as displayed on BBN. He said: “We are going to re-present that bill. You can’t fight a battle without a legal framework; we are definitely going to be conscious of that. “I will take up the issue of Big Brother Naija. I have spoken with officials of the National Broadcasting Commission because what is going on now is terrible. Having love affairs on the screen is not part of our own culture at all. “Let me use this forum to tell Nigerians that a new Big Brother Naija is on its way coming and we are working with Startimes. We are doing BBN that will reflect the true Nigerian culture. We are already working on it, all that will be eaten there will be Nigerian food, the dresses will be Nigerian dresses.” The NCWS president said she was not against the BBN reality show but the sex content was disgusting. Shoda said, “Having live sex on stage is the thing affecting my sensibility and it is impacting negatively on the young children coming up. Does it mean that they can’t abstain from sex for three months? I’m condemning the sex content on BBN.”"

   The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has urged the federal government to immediately place a ban on the Big Brother Naija show. MURIC posited that the reality show promotes immorality in the country branding it as ‘immoral, dangerous and Bohemian’. Professor Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC also said the promoter of the show must be held accountable for promoting immorality in the country “We are being forcibly dragged to a world of nudity, shamelessness and open promiscuity. Inmates of BBNaija kiss, romance and engage in sex openly. BBNaija is Bohemian, anti-social, crude and immoral. It constitutes a potent danger to every home. BBNaija is Satanic. It is unacceptable. “Where are our norms and values? Is it part of African culture to engage in sex in the open? Where are the authorities? Is the Ministry of Information and Culture sleeping? Is the National Orientation Agency on sabbatical? Who will protect our children from this despicable onslaught? Who did this to Nigeria? “This reality show is dragging our children into a life of moral debauchery. It is robbing them of the last vestiges of honour. It is deleting the word ‘shame’ from their vocabulary. BB Naija has alienated our youth from the elders. A yawning lacuna now exists between the young and the old. Irreversible social crisis looms.  “We must see those who woo our young ones with humongous amounts of money, big cars, and palatial buildings as those bent on destroying industry, diligence, and integrity, particularly among the youth. Nothing destroys a nation faster than materialism. The daughters of Jezebel are here already. Unless the authorities move with the speed of lightning, human dignity in Nigeria is going, going, going! “Or do we not realize that for every single BB Naija inmate who wins a big amount of money and a car, more than 50 million young people are misled? Qur’an 30:41 says, ‘Evil has appeared on both land and sea as a result of the handiworks of men…’  The Bible in Ephesians 4:19 was also describing these people when it says, ‘Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.’” MURIC calls for unity among the Christians and Muslims in the country to jointly condemn and force the government to place a ban on the reality show.
 
 “We can put an end to this anomaly called BB Naija if Christians and Muslims bury the hatchet and come together to fight evil. Home is home. Moral debauchery knows no religion. The destructive influence of television shows like BB Naija penetrates both Christian and Muslim homes. “Ditto for the custodians of our culture and tradition. Our traditional rulers ignore a program like this, which has all the potentials to diminish the dignity of our culture. They are fighting over who should be chairman of the council of traditional rulers. They want to be the king of kings and rivals of the supreme creator. Who placed a curse on Nigeria? “Homo sapiens may not respect a single snake when they see one. But can anyone wait to see what follows if the cobra leads and it is faithfully followed by the python, the black mamba, rattlesnake, garter snake, and the anaconda? So what do you think will happen if our traditional rulers from the East, West and North march on Aso Rock to demand the immediate halt of this horrible show?"" MURIC charged the Ministry of Information and Culture to move swiftly against BB Naija before moral debauchery becomes Nigeria’s middle name. "

   In a bid to stem the current tide of public display of nudity and immorality among youths in Nigeria, the National Council of Women Societies and the National Council for Arts and Culture have embarked on sensitisation initiatives. Speaking at a meeting of both organisations in Abuja, National President of the NCWS, Dr Laraba Shoda, condemned the upsurge in public display of nudity following a viral video of near-naked girls dancing in public inside a transparent van in Lagos. She described another scenario where a young lady walked into a mall completely naked as negating the essence of the Nigerian culture, which promotes the dignity of the African woman. Dr Shoda said there was the need to create television programs with good cultural content to arrest the disturbing trend. On his part, the NCAC Director-General, Otunba Segun Runsewe, said the partnership of interest between the women societies and the NCAC will signal a new dawn in the crusade against cultural degeneration and foreign erosion of our culture. According to Runsewe, the NCAC is working on a legislation with the National Assembly to curb the negative trend of public nudity.  "

   A new groom, Adewale Yusuf, who recently shocked many Nigerians by indicating on his wedding invitation card that there would be no reception after the ceremony, has told SaharaReporters that it took him only two calls to convince his parents and other family members to buy into his idea. Though he said it was initially tough to persuade his bride, Blessing, to support the concept, he eventually won her over after a few debates on the issue. The new couple trended last weekend on the social media with many Nigerians applauding and also bashing their decision not to hold a reception for their guests. Speaking with SaharaReporters on Tuesday, Yusuf, said that the decision was one of the biggest he ever took in his life. He said, “When I first informed my parents of the idea not to have a reception after my wedding ceremony, they dropped the call on me. “Eventually, it took me about two more calls to be able to convince them to support my idea. “The truth is that I’m a man of my words. I’m a different person, I am not a loud type. “Many people around me did not like the idea initially but I made sure to let them see reasons with me. “At the end of the day, everyone appreciated my idea.” But despite not staging a reception at their wedding, Yusuf told SaharaReporters that many of their guests didn’t return home without having something to eat. He added, “We shared food for the few friends we invited. I made sure my friends that came from Ibadan went back that day. “One thing people should know is that there is nothing they want that they can’t do as long as it makes them happy and fulfilled. “Having a loud reception after the wedding ceremony was unnecessary as far as I was concerned.” "

Free Speech,REPORTER'S DIARY: 'Who Did You Come To See?' — A Visit To The 'Racist' Shi Shi Chinese Restaurant In Lagos,"1 Year Ago
",/2019/03/22/reporters-diary-who-did-you-come-see-%E2%80%94-visit-racist-shi-shi-chinese-restaurant-lagos,"What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism? SaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos. On arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate. ""Good afternoon,"" we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard. ""Who did you come to see?"" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: ""Is this not a restaurant?"" The security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back. The team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out). The entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there. In the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: ""Can I see your menu?"" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there. We were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones. As we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant. She beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone. Sigh. We continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first. In a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward ‘glance lock’, ‘Camera lady’ approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks. Please note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders ""looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms"" in the restaurant. And so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions. Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me. I wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors. She walked up to us and said ""hello"" and stayed there. A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place. One member of the team queried if ""everyone is welcome here?"" to which she simply said ""yes"". She then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?). As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery. I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building. How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti? It turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo. More suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it. From our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard’s inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google. There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out. Would they have done all that if we were Chinese? In the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception."

 Nigeria's inflation rate has dropped by 0.06 in the last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. According to the Consumer Price Index, the inflation rate dropped from 11.08 percent in July to 11.02 percent in August. The NBS said that the drop in inflation rate continued in August despite several pronouncements regarding restrictions on the import of some food items, minimum wage, and the recent border closures. Similarly, food inflation dropped to 13.17% from 13.39%, while core inflation dropped to 8.68% from 8.80% recorded in the previous month. With respect to the impact of border closure on consumer prices, the bureau stated that the country may not see the significant effect on inflation now as the closure was only captured for 11 days during the 31 days reference period in August. According to the bureau, the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of oils and fats, meat, bread and cereals, potatoes, yam, and other tubers and fish. On a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index increased by 1.22% in August 2019, down by 0.04% points from 1.26% recorded in July 2019."

   Legendary Nigerian singer and guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, has revealed why he sued Nigerian singer, Simisola Bolatito Ogunleye, aka Simi, for N50 million. Uwaifo accused the songstress of ""stealing"" his intellectual property, 'Joromi'. In an exclusive interview with SaharaReporters shortly after his performance at the just concluded National Festival of Arts and Culture in Edo State, he said: “We’re in court already I sued her at the federal high court for N50 million. They will be coming to court.” When Sahara Reporters asked if Simi had reached out to him privately, he answered: “No, only through her lawyers. We will meet in court.” Over a year ago, Uwaifo had told SaharaReporters that Simi was in trouble for failing credit for the song, Joromi, which she remixed. He had said, when asked if he was going to take any legal action against Simi, “One after the other. I cannot just take everybody to court at the same time. I don’t know whether he or she; I know she is but I know somebody is behind it.  ""An LP was sent as a compliment; I'm still looking at it but they were planning to come to Benin to see me. Up till now, they haven't come. So I'm just putting that one on hold. 'Joromi' is a franchise. The name never existed before. Benin don’t have 'J' in their language. If any started with 'J' in Benin then it is fake. All consonant words start with vowel sounds. For example, if I use the trademark of one of these soft drinks, it is wrong. So Simi is in trouble.”"
Arts,Simi Vs Victor Uwaifo: The True Story Of 'Joromi',"6 Months Ago
",/2019/11/01/simi-vs-victor-uwaifo-true-story-joromi,"  In recent times, Nigerian singer Simi has had her name mentioned several times by Nigerian legendary guitarist, Sir Victor Uwaifo, over what he claimed to be a copyright infringement of his song, 'Joromi'. Simi is being sued for N50 million damages for using the word 'Joromi' in her song and as the title of one of her tracks. 'Joromi' was the same song title Uwaifo gave to his 1979 global hit. The case between both artistes is generating debates on what constitutes copyright infringement. Amidst this, SaharaReporters visited the historical 'Revelation Tourist Palazzo' built and developed by Uwaifo where it was revealed that the name 'Joromi' was not just the title of a song but the name of a famous fighter from Benin. Giving a tour of the centre, the curator, Chris Eburu, said prior to the death of Joromi’s father, he warned Joromi not to climb the palm tree located at the backyard of the house. However, Joromi defied this order and met his death in the hands of a masquerade in hellfire. Eburu said: ""Joromi was a famous wrestler in Benin. He dislodged everyone who dared him. He was the champion. When his father was about to die, the only thing he bequeathed to his son was a warning. “He warned him never to climb the palm tree at the backyard but when the father died, on one Sunday afternoon as Joromi was taking a stroll around his father’s backyard he spotted this particular palm tree and looked at it pensively and began to wonder why his father told him not to climb the palm tree. “The daring Joromi climbed on top of it while his sister turned into a fly and accompanied him. When they eventually got to the zenith of that tree, they grew out of the natural state and they landed in a place called 'hell' where Joromi noticed with dismay that the least person in hell had two heads but Joromi wanted to fight, the battle line was drawn."" Continuing the myth, the curator said, “From one to the other, he conquered all of them from the one that had two heads then to the ones that had six heads he destroyed all of them plucking off their extra heads and telling them categorically that they were better off having one head. ""'Who asked you to have more than one (head)? On earth, we have one head. Who asked you to have more than one head?' Joromi queried but when the seven-headed spirit, Ugbogweli appeared - in fact, he was breathing and smoking fire all over him - that was when Joromi sister began to sing. ""Joromi once more turned deaf ears and for the first time as he ran down to the battle line, he witnessed a bitter piece of death for the very first time.  Life was off him and the man called Joromi died."" However, Eburu said, ""Luckily for him, the sister spotted a leaf that had life in it. She plucked it, squeezed it and subsequently applied the juice on the five senses of the brother who now regained consciousness. ""This time when he stood up he was no longer ready to fight and he began to race back to earth but Ugbogweli would never let him go. When he got to the bridge between hellfire and earth and was about to cross to the latter, Ugbogweli stretched his hand to grab Joromi but luckily for Joromi Ugbogweli could run his fingers down the back of Joromi."" The curator then made a curious statement: ""Those of us in this part of the world hold the belief that the encounter that Joromi had with Ugbogweli is the cause of the spines humans have.""  "
Money,Banking Sector’s Loss Is Entertainment Industry’s Gain,"7 Months Ago
",/2019/10/04/banking-sector%E2%80%99s-loss-entertainment-industry%E2%80%99s-gain,"
 
   The entertainment industry is emerging as the market that will absorb much of the loans the central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is forcing commercial banks to give. A report by Proshare indicates that banks are positioning themselves to attract clients from small and medium scale enterprises in the music and movie space. However, analysts Sahara Reporters have spoken to and reports published by financial research firms, conclude that the increased pressure on banks to lend much of their deposit, is negative for the finance industry at this point. “We believe this development — the 65 percent loan to deposit ratio is largely negative for the banking sector, which has only just recovered from the weak asset quality issues prevalent since 2016,” Cardinalstone research said in a report. “We also believe that the macro-environment is still too fragile to support strong growth in lending,” it added. Adedayo Bakare, an analyst with Afrinvest gave Sahara Reporters a similar outlook. He said tier one banks – the most stable lenders, do not operate a banking model that allows them to give loans to customers that are highly likely not to pay back. This, however, are the type of customers the CBN wants the banks to target. True to Bakare’s observation, two of the three-tier 1 lenders, Zenith and Guarantee Trust, are among the 12 lenders fined a combined total of over N499bn by the CBN for their inability to meet with the September 2019 target of borrowing 60 percent of their deposits to the real sector. The third lender – Access bank, survived thanks to the huge loan portfolio it inherited from Tier 2 Diamond bank. Proshare is of the opinion that these lenders have looked to the safety of the celebrity industry, to reduce the risk of borrowing funds to the everyday farmer and small-time shoemaker. In a report published Thursday, it listed a series of creative packages Deposit Money Banks are adapting to build quality assets in the creative space. The most audacious plan is Access bank’s Creative Arts village in Ogun State. Proshare notes that the village will help to ‘address issues like the location for movie production, capacity building for practitioners, and deepening the ecosystem of the Arts and Entertainment industry in Nigeria.’ Herbert wigwe, the managing director of Access Bank, expects the village to create 2 to 3m jobs annually. The size of Access bank’s investment in Ogun State is indicative of the feeling in the industry. Cardinalstone notes that commercial lenders will likely be ‘antsy in their strategies to grow loans.’ The research firm is also of the view that the new measures are also likely to force banks to anxiously re-evaluate their loan growth Strategy. One of such strategies is the United Bank of Africa (UBA’s) decision to make Wizkid its ambassador. It had also hosted a discourse ""Stars and Suits: Afropop meets High Finance,"" that conference gave UBA the opportunity to build a collaboration between music stars and finance institutions. Zenith, ECO Bank, and GT are other banks that have and are building more partnerships with clientele in the creative industry. These moves are no doubt, attempts by banks to keep their assets relatively strong, under the climate of a policy analysts expect to weaken them.  "

   Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first-ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, “Lionheart” has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The panel said the movie had ""too much English dialogue"". The movie which was directed by ace Nollywood actress, Genevieve Nnaji, according to the Los Angeles Times ran afoul of the academy rule which states that an International feature film category must have “a predominantly non-English dialogue track.” “Lionheart” is among the 10 African films that were submitted for Oscar consideration this year. “This isn’t the first time the academy has disqualified a foreign film from consideration for having too much English dialogue; in recent years, the 2015 Afghan film, Utopia, and the 2007 Israeli movie, The Band’s Visit, were disqualified for the same reason,” Los Angeles Times reports.   Since this news broke, there have been arguments for and against the decision by Oscar. Giving her reaction, an American filmmaker,  Ava Duvernay wondered why the movie was disqualified when the official language of Nigeria was English. In a tweet on her official Twitter handle she wrote: “To the academy (Oscar), You disqualified Nigeria’s first-ever submission for Best International Feature because its in English. But English is the official language of Nigeria. Are you barring this country from ever competing for an Oscar in its official language?” In her response to Ava Duvernay’s tweet, Genevieve Nnaji said: “I am the director of Lionheart. This movie represents the way we speak as Nigerians. This includes English which acts as a bridge between the 500+ languages spoken in our country; thereby making us one Nigeria. “It’s no different to how French connects communities in former French colonies. We did not choose who colonized us. As ever, this film and many like it is proudly Nigerian.” For Nigerian actor, Deyemi, he chose to see the positive side, saying: “I can only imagine how many more views Lionheart will have on Netflix by the end of today! Anyhow you look at it this is a win! Stay winning.” “To think that some Nigerians actually complained that Lionheart had too much Igbo! Only for the Oscars to think it has too much English? Total BS! Honestly, I don’t even care for the Oscars at this point! They might as well change the name back to 'Foreign language',"" a Twitter user, Steven Chuks, stated. 
 
 Another Twitter user, Britain Danielle, said, “Something about this doesn't seem fair. The film was disqualified because it's mostly in English. Meanwhile, the official language of Nigeria is....English.”"

They train very hard, they perform very well but at the end of the day, what gets to them is peanuts. “The industry will have to restructure itself in such a way that there will be capable and competent managers that will manage their artists. “All of these must be put in place so that whenever talent is exhibited, it will be protected.”  "

   An undercover investigation by Sahara Reporters in January this year had revealed that the movie whose right was exclusively bought by online streaming platform, Netflix was been pirated in Alaba Markets, Lagos and sold for just N70. In October, wild reactions trailed the selection of “Lionheart” by the Nigerian Oscars Selection Committee, NOSC, to represent Nollywood at the 2020 Oscars as there was varying reactions and argument as why the movie should have or not have been selected.  Today, Nigerians woke up to the news that their first ever submission for best international feature Oscar consideration, “Lionheart” has been disqualified by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences saying it had too much English dialogue.  
 
 The movie which was directed by ace Nollywood actress, Genevieve Nnaji according to the Los Angeles Times ran afoul of the academy rule which states that an International feature film category must have “a predominantly non-English dialogue track.” Amidst all this, we bring to you an investigative report done by us highlighting how deep piracy has eaten into the Nigeria movie industry.

Economy,"Closure Of Border Cannot End Smuggling, ECOWAS Tells Nigeria","8 Months Ago

 The Economic Community Of West African States has told the Nigerian Government that closing its border with other neighbouring countries cannot prevent the smuggling of goods and products into Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari had announced the closure of the border, saying that it would prevent bringing products into the country illegally and also help boost the patronage of locally made products. Disagreeing with President Buhari, ECOWAS stated that the border closure would also affect the implementation of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Act signed by the country. In a statement on Tuesday, the bloc said,“The ECOWAS Parliament calls for compliance with community provisions and the reopening of borders and a coordinated fight against smuggling in the region. “The root causes of this recurrent situation must be studied with a view to finding a permanent solution.”"
Economy,Emefiele Blames IOC’S For Non-Review Of Production Sharing Contracts,"7 Months Ago
",/2019/09/23/emefiele-blames-ioc%E2%80%99s-non-review-production-sharing-contracts,"
 
 Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has blamed international oil companies for the failure of the government to execute constitutionally mandated reviews to the Production Sharing Contracts signed in 1993. Emefiele, who is part of a team of top government officials in London to attend another ruling on the asset seizure claim by Process and Industrial Development, told Reutersthat the multinationals intentionally refused to trigger a review that was to see the government get more proceeds once a barrel of oil rose above $20. He said, “It stands for me to reason that the IOCs deliberately did not trigger event for review because it benefits them – and that is something that we kick against. “You think it should be forgotten and we shouldn’t revisit it given that it resulted in substantial loss of revenue to the government?” Former Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Ibe Kachikwu, had at different times during his reign said that the country lost $21bn to the failure of government to review the PSC as required by the act. He had also promised that the PSC will be duly reviewed. Section 16 of the Deep Offshore And Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act, which was first signed in 1993 and amended in 1999, provides for the contract to be reviewed every 15 years and for the oil companies, who operate the offshore fields to review the revenue sharing contracts to favour the Nigerian Government more once a barrel of oil sold for $20 and above. The former condition was due in 2008, while the latter was due around 2003. Neither the 1993 or 1999 amendment mandates the oil companies to trigger the review as Emefiele claimed. The government signed more PSC’s under more stringent terms in 2000 and 2005. Experts have however argued that the reviews provided for by the constitution, were bound to interfere with the life cycle of the financial projections of the oil fields. They instead suggested that the government allow the 1993 contracts run down and then make reviews on renewals. The Supreme Court had in October 2018 ordered the Nigerian Government to recover funds lost to the PSC and share same with the three tiers of government."
Money,"UK Receives £90bn Stolen Funds Yearly From Nigeria, Others –Experts","6 Months Ago
",/2019/10/21/uk-receives-%C2%A390bn-stolen-funds-yearly-nigeria-others-%E2%80%93experts,"
 
 The United Kingdom receives not less than £90bn shady funds from Nigeria and other countries across the world every year, a team of foreign experts said in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, on Monday. The experts said 87,000 illicit assets in UK are owned by anonymous companies in tax havens, while the values of secretly owned properties in the UK are between £56bn to £100bn. Forty per cent of these properties are in the city of London, they affirmed. The revelation was made by world acclaimed anti-corruption advocates, Christian Erikson and Lionel Faull, in a joint paper tagged Obtaining Property Information Overseas presented at the ongoing anti-corruption training organised by the Human and Environmental Development Agenda in collaboration with international groups. The programme drew 70 civil society organisations, media, labour and representatives of anti-corruption institutions from across the Southern region of Nigeria. In his remarks, Nick Hildyard, an anti-corruption investigator, said though the UK has one of the most effective anti-corruption laws, but that in reality the country does not appear to be fully prepared to stall the wave of corruption with her financial institutions providing the logistics for corrupt officials from Nigeria. “The UK is a legally corrupt country,” Hildyard said, adding that if Western countries genuinely wish to fight corruption, they should stop the warehouse of stolen funds from Nigeria. Faull said, “Getting your money back is easier said than done. It takes a long time. “If you do not support corruption, there is no need doing banking with Nigeria. “The fight against corruption will not succeed without a very active citizenry. “It requires international solidarity, teaming up with civil society in order to work with international organisations and make authorities accountable.” In his presentation, HEDA Chairman, Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, said about 456 top Nigerian public officials holding strategic positions are yet to declare their assets in spite of the regulations put in place by the Code of Conduct Bureau. In her presentation, Prof Ayo Atsenuwa of the University of Lagos said that though the Freedom of Information law had opened fresh opportunities for Nigerians to hold their leaders accountable, Nigeria, unlike many other countries and jurisdictions, lacks a policy, guideline or law on public access of court documents."

 Traders in Kaduna State have rejected the announcement by Governor Nasir el-Rufai to expand some markets in the state. El-Rufai had in a media chat said that some markets in the state have been listed for expansion which includes Kasuwar Barchi, Sabon Gari and Central markets (Shaikh Gumi). He also said that while some markets will be moved, new ones will be built. “These markets need expansion and we are going to expand them. We also intend to build new markets in neighbourhood communities like shopping malls where people will go and rent shops‎. “From here we will also move to Zaria and Kafanchan towns to build new markets. We just have to develop the state,” he said. Rejecting the plans, the traders in the markets who spoke with Arewa Trust Weekly, said the governor is making move to eject them from the markets while also adding that the governor would not provide an alternative for them. Jafaru Madobi labeled the expansion as ‘wickedness’ saying that traders are pleading with God to change the mind of the governor. He said: “This to us is wickedness because as I speak we are all worried and confused. We all know that by the time the market is demolished many of us will not be given another shop. For me what we need is capital from the governor not market expansion.” Usman Mani, a secondhand cloth seller, said that traders in the markets highlighted for demolition do not have the financial capability to rent shops and stalls in the new markets after reconstruction by the government. He said, “We are worried since the pronouncement by the governor because there is no alternative provided to us. Where does he want us to go because majority of us cannot afford the kind of money to rent the new shops after the expansion? “We also expected to hear him talk about paying compensation for our shops to be demolished but he didn’t say anything in that regard. So as far as I’m concerned these expansions will only lead to unemployment rather than providing jobs because by the time he forces us to leave many will be out of business.” Sani Muhammad, a tailor in the market, said the special prayers were conducted in some mosques within the market against the plan. “There were special prayers against the plan because many of us are worried about the expansion. We are worried due to lack of alternative for traders if the expansion begins,” he said."

 Aremu Afolayan, an actor and filmmaker, has slammed at the critics who have tagged him a gigolo. In an interview with Scoop Sunday, the actor, who is a brother to Kunle Afolayan, a Nollywood producer, said if his critics got the exposure and opportunity, they had been a gigolo. He said being in a relationship with an older person does not mean he gets financial benefit from it. Afolayan said, “That is an old gist, and I really don’t want to talk about it. But, even if I am doing that, it is nobody’s business. I am sure (the people talking, would) also want to do that (if they had the opportunity). “I am a businessman, and you can actually refer to me as a prostitute in business. I sell cars, clothes, wrist watches, and many other things. Dating someone older than one is different from someone older paying one’s bills. I don’t think there is anything wrong in dating or marrying someone older than one.” He also debunked assumptions that Nollywood actresses engage in prostitution or sex for roles. On why actresses seemed to fare better than actors in the industry, Afolayan said, “Most people have a side business. Even many Hollywood celebrities have side businesses. One problem, though, is that some people live up to certain expectations that nobody is even asking them to in the first place. ""But ordinarily, both male and female actors should be making so much money that they should be the one sponsoring politicians, and not the other way round.”  "
Business,Nigeria On World Bank Top-20 'Improvers In Doing Business',"7 Months Ago

   The World Bank Doing Business team has announced Nigeria as one of the top-20 improvers in doing business out of 190 countries. Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, Special Adviser to the President, Ease of Doing Business, disclosed this a statement in Abuja. She said that the announcement came ahead of the Oct. 24 release of the 2020 World Bank Doing Business rankings. Oduwole said that the World Bank Doing Business Report was an objective assessment of prevailing business environments based on a number of ease of doing business indicators. According to her, in Nigeria, the report assesses doing business conditions in the two largest commercial cities of Lagos and Kano. Oduwole said, “The World Bank’s announcement acknowledges reforms spearheaded by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council(PEBEC) in the areas of operationalizing a new electronic platform that integrates the tax authority and the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). “It also acknowledges reforms carried out in some of the World Bank Doing Business indicator areas such as starting a business, registering property, getting construction permits, getting electricity, enforcing contracts, and trading across borders. “The CAC also upgraded its name reservation platform and, in Kano, there is now an electronic platform for registering business premises online, eliminating the need to appear in person."" She added, “In Lagos, land administration was made more transparent following the digitization of cadastral plans in a geographic information system; digital copies of cadastral plans are now easily obtainable. ""Nigeria also made getting electricity easier by allowing certified engineers to conduct inspections for new connections. Initiatives also made commercial litigation of smaller cases more efficient. “The chief judges in Lagos and Kano issued practice directions for small claims courts introducing pre-trial conferences and limit adjournments. “Finally, customs integrated more agencies into its electronic data interchange system, and port authorities launched an e-payment system, speeding up both exports and imports.” She said that over the past three years, Nigeria’s score had steadily improved in the World Bank Doing Business Report, after years of decline in both score and ranking in the years preceding 2016. Oduwole, who is also PEBEC Secretary, said that in 2017, Nigeria moved up by an unprecedented 24 places on the Doing Business rankings. The presidential aide said that for the first-ever, Nigeria was also recognized as one of the top 10 reformers in the area of doing business that year. Oduwole, said that the recognition being given to Nigeria was one of the top 20 most improved countries, who had implemented the most reforms in 2019 was significant. According to her, the validation confirms that PEBEC’s strategy is working and it will continue to push even harder. She explained, “These improvements in the standing of Nigeria trail the reform agenda being implemented at national and sub-national levels across the country since the establishment of PEBEC by President Muhammadu Buhari in July 2016. “The PEBEC works towards the fulfilment of the projections of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP 2017-2020), which is striving to deliver sustainable economic growth in Nigeria by restoring growth, investing in our people, and building a competitive economy. “PEBEC, through the Enabling Business Environment Secretariat, has carried out over 140 reforms so far in a bid to remove bureaucratic constraints to doing business in Nigeria and make the country a progressively easier place to start and grow a business. “With the impending ratification of the Companies and Allied Matters Bill and the introduction of the Business Facilitation (Omnibus) Bill, 2019 in view, along with other pending regulatory, judicial and sub-national reforms, Nigeria is poised to meet its goal of being a top 100 ranked economy by 2020. “The announcement indicates that our goal of moving into the top 70 doing business destinations by 2023 remains achievable.”"

   Details from the Ease of Doing Business report for 2020 has showed that Nigeria made improvement in six of the 10 areas measured by the bank. The country was however, used as a case study on poor procurement – a lapse that will count in the 2121 edition of the study. According to the study, Nigeria leaped from 145 to 131 but could suffer a setback when contracting with the government is added to the 10 topics currently measured by the World Bank commissioned research. According to the report, the Nigerian Government awarded a contract for the rehabilitation of a local road in 2007. The report said, “The works were slated to begin in 2009 but the project specifications had been designed six years before the contract was awarded. “By the time the contractor started the work, the condition of the road had deteriorated significantly.” The bank said the project was awarded at less than 60 per cent of the cost required to execute it. It added, “At the expiration of the contract period in June 2012, the project was only eight per cent complete. “A decade after the contract award, rehabilitation works were still underway and a trip that would typically take one hour took four.” Since this factor did not feature in the 2020 report, Nigeria was for the second time recognised for being among the top 10 improved economies out of the 190 measured by the researchers. The country shared this position with Togo. According to the report, the desire of a government to make improvements on how its territory does business is caused by the achievements made in countries that are geographically or culturally close. The report credits Rwanda with coercing Togo to becoming the best place to do business in West Africa, while Kenya is credited with having a similar effect on Nigeria. Nigeria was also given recognition for making improvements on the enforcement of contracts and easing access to credits. The report noted that the largest credit report company in the country, CRC Bureau, only captured four per cent of the adult population in 2007 but now hosts the database of the loan repayment history of 14 per cent of the adult population."

   The Nigeria Stock Exchange on Tuesday effected a full suspension on the trading of shares of Dangote Flour Mills as a precursor to its delisting and takeover by Crown Flour Mills. This will be the second time the company will get sold in the last seven years after it was bought by South Africa-based Tiger Foods in 2012 and returned three years later. “The suspension is imperative to prevent trading in the shares of the company beyond the effective date of the scheme of arrangement for Crown Flour Mills Limited to acquire the entire issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 kobo each in DFM held by scheme shareholders, subsequent to which the company would be delisted from the main board of the NSE,” a statement from the NSE said. The board of directors of the company had in April received an offer from Olam – the parent company of Crown Flour Mill for the sale of the company. The firm and the board agreed to pay N130bn for five billion worth of ordinary shares listed by DFM. The board proposed to make the offer to its shareholders on August 5 through a high court ordered meeting that was scheduled to hold on October 14. Tiger Foods sold DFM back to Dangote in 2015 for a single dollar after it had acquired the company for $200m. The company had made losses in the years it was owned by the South African firm. DFM again announced that it made a loss of N1.16bn just before it agreed to sell the firm to Olam. Experts say Olam’s acquisition of the staggering firm is an attempt to expand its influence in the country’s confectionery space through Crown, which it purchased in 2010."

Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Ighile, while granting Iyanya bail, said, “I have perused the affidavit and the counter-affidavit of the parties; there is a prima facie case of criminal conversion against him. “However, there is nothing to show that the defendant will interfere with the proceedings of this case and nothing to show that he will jump bail if granted. “Bail is, therefore, granted to the defendant in the sum of N20m with one surety in like sum.” She ordered that the surety should have a landed property in Lagos and possess its certificate of occupancy.

 Nigerian singer David Adeleke, aka Davido, says there is no money Osun State can make in the next 40 years that his father, Adedeji Adeleke, has not already made as the 'omo baba olowo' crooner revealed why he stayed away from Nigeria for eight months. A similar controversial statement regarding the paltry financial capacity of Osun was made by the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. Contrary to beliefs that Davido was away from the country to promote his music on the international scene, the singer said he had to leave the country of some time due to the fillers he was getting that the government was after him. According to him, he needed to protect his family and associates which he was why he left the country. The singer made this known at his album private listening event, Wednesday night, which held at Landmark Events, Victoria Island, where he disclosed that if he had chosen to stay things would not have gone smoothly for him as the government were beginning to track his activities. The singer whose album, 'A Good Time', will be released in October while fielding questions from MTV Base TV host, Ehiz, said, “With the whole politics thing it was first about family. Honestly, it was first about family. I was in Osun with my guys. We saw everything in plain sight. Let me tell you a story about my uncle. My uncle is the last born of the family. The original politician of the family is Serubawon, my father’s elder brother. “He was the first governor of Osun state; came back then went for senator you know when everybody for the state knows that this is the next governor and then we just woke up one day and they said he went to eat somewhere and he died. “Yoruba culture when somebody holds an office and he passes on they either give the bride or the close relatives. The next in line is B red’s daddy and he is just a happy person. He doesn’t like politics but when you lose your brother everybody knows what’s up. With that, they wanted to give my uncle automatically. “A day to them swearing him in as senator they said no we want to do re-election another guy has come up and my father doesn’t like wahala so he said let’s go to the other party if we lose we pack our thing and go. The next day we did election my uncle cleared 16 out of 17 local government areas. “He became a senator in just a week. His own journey to winning that governorship primary election was out of sight that was how we knew this one nah God. “It was painful and will tell everybody here that was the real reason I was not even in the country because of the politics. I have to watch what I say. If I was around he no go dey OK for me and my people. So I had to be a man and say look let me stay away. “We have Adeleke University all the roads that lead was done by my father. There’s no money Osun wants to make in the next 30 to 40 years that my father has not made. The way things turned out was crazy. When asked if he got any backlash for doing what he did, he said no. According to him, he met an APC chieftain at a wedding in Paris where they both shared a joke. He said he “felt shebi una don take am"". ""That’s why I'm back,"" he explained. ""I’m praying every day for the country. Everybody is complaining why you talking about politics. I have an American passport I could have chosen to stay there. But this is home and I am comfortable here.”  "

   The Nigeria Immigration Service has queried its officers, who appeared in a viral music video challenge, threatening to take severe actions against them as punishment. According to a statement by Iam Haliru, Assistant Comptroller General of the NIS, the viral video clip tagged #BopDaddyChallenge, has caused the organisation a lot of embarrassment. 'Bop Daddy' is the latest song by Nigerian rapper, Folarin Falana popularly known as Falz.  : Nigerian Immigration Service Threatens To Sack Employees For Participating In  âs âBop Daddyâ Video Challenge      A trained lawyer, Falz is the son of Senior Advocate of Nigeria and human rights defender, Femi Falana. The NIS statement partly reads, “The attention of the Comptroller General has been drawn to a video clip trending on the social media in recent times which revealed a rather disturbing and embarrassing display of indecent flaunting of your bodies, desecration of service uniform/beret and the use of inappropriate language, thereby sabotaging the values upheld by the service. “To state the obvious, your act has caused a lot of embarrassment to the NIS and in line with our standard as a paramilitary organisation, is considered scandalous and an act unbecoming of an officer and therefore a violation of PSR 030401 and 030402. This is a serious misconduct liable to dismissal from service.  “In view of the foregoing, therefore, you are requested to make a representation, if any, within 72 hours on receipt of this letter why disciplinary action should not be taken against you.”
 
 
 Falz’s 'Bop Daddy' video, inspired by the Coronavirus lockdown, has made several top music charts across Nigeria and beyond in recent days for its message and ability to grip viewers’ attention. In August 2018, the National Broadcasting Commission, banned ‘This is Nigeria’ a widely received by Falz. According to the agency, part of the song contained vulgar language and therefore inappropriate for public consumption. The Muslim Right Concern also accused him of using the video of the song to ridicule Islam, a claim which was widely condemned by Nigeria of all religions. Falz has won several local and international awards for his music, which often exposes the ills in the society and exposes government’s insincerity to the people.   "

   Nigerian policeman, Abayomi Ekundayo widely known as GucciManeEko or Yomi SARS by his teeming admirers, has said that combining police work with a career in music has exposed him to criticisms a lot. The 30-year-old cop, who has partnered top artistes like Olamide, Davido, Wizkid, Pasuma and a host of others, said that due to his involvement with music, some persons usually thought he was not a serious policeman. According to the young man, who claimed to have been born with a ‘silver spoon’ but decided to leave home early to discover his path in life, combining both professions – music and policing – has helped him reach more people and help solve a lot of social problems in a different style. He said, “I was born with a silver spoon but I left the comfort of my home to be on the street because I wanted to discover my path early in life and be a better person. “But being a musician and a cop means that I have become a prime target for criticism. “But I have learnt to handle those criticisms well especially the ones on social media.” Maintaining that not all police personnel were corrupt or wicked as widely perceived by a greater percentage of Nigerians, Yomi SARS, who recently released hits including ‘Japa’ (produced by Young John), ‘Adoyoyo’, ‘Gucci Mane Eko’, 'No case' (Featuring Davido, Pasuma, DJ Jimmy Jatt), 'Follow Me' featuring Olamide and many others, said that law enforcement agencies like the police must work closely with members of the public to better protect the society. He said, “The #EndSARS is no longer one that any responsible citizen-minded police officer can ignore, not necessarily giving credence to some of the gory yet vivid narrations but policing is to maintain the public peace in whatever guise the unrest may come. “Definitely some officers are on the extreme in the line of duty, some are on the job for personal gratification but we must commend the larger percentage who are worthy ambassadors of the Nigeria Police Force. “I am referring to those that daily defy the lack of basic needs like accommodation, uniform and other kits, up to date technology and equipment to carry out their duties.  ""However, this shouldn't stop the police from looking into the various allegations levelled against the body, investigate and weed out the wolves amongst us.” Signed to Dypes Entertainment and now co-founder of SAPON-GANG, the policeman-turned musician is set to release a new album in the coming weeks after the success of his debut work in 2019.  "

 Hip hop musician, Eedris Abdulkareem, has called out his landlord, one Mr Oladipo Abimbola, for allegedly sexually harassing his wife. Speaking with SaharaReporters, the artiste denied being arrested by the police as claimed in some quarters, adding that he leads a discipline and transparent life. He said, “My problem with our landlord is his pervasive and predatory ways.  “He comes to my house whenever he knows that I am not around to harass my wife. He seems obsessed with her. I don't understand why he cannot approach or talk to me whenever the need arises. He accosts her at home and on the streets.  “He starts off with talking about the house before progressing gradually to his main interest. I have warned him several times to steer clear and stop harassing my wife. “On a particular day, my landlord probably thought I wasn't around; so he made his moves again using the electricity providers as a ploy. Unfortunately for him, I was upstairs and overheard my wife telling him to stop harassing her because she was a married woman and that she doesn't tolerate such actions from men.  “I came downstairs and went to his own side of the property (a twin duplex), through the adjoining gate and lashed out at him. “He has deliberately kept his family away so as to have the freedom needed for his nefarious lifestyle. Explaining that news of his arrest in the media was false, Abdulkareem said that he was only invited by the police over a malicious report made about him by his landlord. He said, “When I received a police invitation from the Ikeja Area Command inviting me for a chat based on my landlord's claims that I beat him up and threatened his life; I wasted no time in honouring the invitation on the same day. “I was appalled by the lies and apparent pre-emptive haste on the part of my landlord to perhaps play smart since I have warned him to stop harassing my wife sexually. “I also told the police about a case involving one of his tenants, a single mother living in one of his properties in Mangoro area, who had to arrest and lock him up at a police station in Shasha area of Dopemu, Lagos, over the same issue of harassment.  “As a social crusader and a voice of the voiceless, humility has always been my watchword in my personal space, and that is not about to change overnight.  “I am not materialistic and I have never been one to showcase and flash materialism as an achievement.  “For me, the best achievement is that which uplifts the people and put smiles on their faces. “The landlord who was present when the appointment made in the presence of the Area Commander the previous day was nowhere to be found. He even switched off his phone so the IPO would not be able to reach him.” Denying reports that he was owing electricity bills and having issues with the distribution company, the musician said, “As for the issues with electricity providers, that is a war we have already taken on, personally and collectively.  “Just a cursory look or assessment of my estate will tell you that we depend on our individual generators to provide power, while the electricity providers keep sending outrageous estimated bills every other month. “There's so much coming up concerning the electricity struggle soon. “For naysayers and doubting Thomases, I will always be me. I keep my personal life quiet, so no one should think they know me. People only know what i allow them to know about me.” Efforts to get Mr Abimbola to respond to the allegations were unsuccessful as calls and a text message sent to him were not responded to. "

 The Lagos Chambers of Commerce and Industry expects the Nigerian economy to have a suppressed economic performance the coming year.  Director-General of the industry trade group, Muda Yusuf, said the country’s economy will grow by two per cent in 2020. News Agency of Nigeria reports that the LCCI give this verdict in its 2019 Economic Review and Outlook for 2020. “We expect economic growth to remain subdued at around two per cent by 2020 as consumer demand, as well as private sector investment, will most likely remain weak. “We are of the view that failure by government to fix structural constraints with regards to fixing power challenges and rehabilitating deplorable road networks, will perpetuate the poor productivity and performance of the sector. “In our opinion, continued protectionist measures of government will most likely limit growth in 2020. “Elsewhere, the level of the country’s engagement in Africa Continental Free Trade Area scheduled to kick-off July 1, 2020, will also impact the performance of trade sector. “As a sustainable solution, it is imperative to fix the fundamental issues of high cost of domestic production, the prohibitive cost of cargo clearing at the Lagos ports, prohibitive import tariffs, high cost of logistics within the economy, and border policy capacity,” he said. The group also anticipates headline inflation to continue on its upward surge."

 Thousands of informal workers and small-scale entrepreneurs in Nigeria, who have been rendered jobless as the lockdown continues in different parts of the country, are counting their losses as government struggles to contain the  spread of Coronavirus. Worried by the decline in their income and the attendant hardship, they are begging government to relax the lockdown or grant them palliatives to survive the period.  Already, there is growing concern that another extension of the lockdown could lead to hunger, frustration and unrest. Informal workers affected by the lockdown include event planners, caterers, local food vendors, artisans, street traders and other small-scale business owners, who rely on daily income to feed themselves and their families.  The informal sector contributes immensely to Nigeria's economy.  Economic measures put in place by the federal and state governments have been faulted because of its coordination and implementation.  Many workers and families complained that they received nothing from the government. The informal workers spoke in separate interviews with SaharaReporters on Tuesday. “Since this total lockdown started, my make-up business has stopped due to the fact that nobody is organising parties, dinners and get-together again. “I had wedding jobs this month of April that was supposed to fetch me over N40,000 but they were cancelled due to this lockdown,” Oyindasola Taiwo, a stylist and make-up artist told SaharaReporters. She lamented that since the outbreak of the virus in Nigeria, her clients had been forced to cancel their parties. “I'm afraid, if the lockdown is extended again, I might have to collect low pay for jobs.  ""Our products are becoming more expensive than it used to be. No job to do, no money,"" she said.  Also narrating her ordeal, Event Manager of Tana Explixi, a surprise factory, who simply introduced herself as Toyin, said she had to decline job offers due to the lockdown.  She also said that clients were becoming afraid of patronising them as they may get exposed to the virus. She said, “In spite of the lockdown, some people still wish to surprise their loved ones but there is no means of transportation to get to the locations. “Some of our clients had to cancel our job because they are afraid of being infected.  ""People working with me are unable to get paid because the company’s funds have gone down since we have not been able to work.” Mrs Olaniyan, a caterer in Lagos, has a similar tale.  She lamented that her family had resorted to getting loans from friends and families in order to survive due to the lockdown. “Some of us feed our families with these small jobs that we do weekly.  ""We get paid, send children to school and maintain the family but since the lockdown, we have not been able to work. “No events, no job, children are back home and we struggle to feed especially since the relief materials are not getting to us.  ""We have no choice than to go borrowing.  ""As soon as this is over, the first thing we have to think about is how to refund these loans,” she said.  "

 The Nigerian Senate has dropped its interest in breaking up the monopoly of System Specs, the firm which handles the Remita platform responsible for processing payments into the Treasury Single Account.  A member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions, anonymously informed PUNCH that its investigations did not show any serious reason for concern. He said, “We are already in touch with the Federal Ministry of Finance and management of System Specs and from all indications, the current arrangement seems to be working for the country. “We were acting on petitions from certain people, who drew the Senate’s attention to the dangers inherent in the current monopoly by System Specs but a careful investigation revealed that it wasn’t as serious as being projected.” The committee had in November started exploring ways of breaking up the single-hold of System Specs on the management of the TSA payment platform.  Its move followed petitions it had received from concerned individuals."

",/2020/05/09/more-nigerians-take-businesses-online-covid-19-restricts-movement-threatens-incomes,"The lockdown in most Nigerian cities put in place as part of measures to stop the spread of Coronavirus has caused a lot of businesses to suffer losses while also creating an opportunity for innovative ideas through digital technology to sail through. Before the outbreak of COVID-19, the e-commerce market in Nigeria was worth around $20bn. It was projected to rise to $50bn over the next seven years, contributing at least N25trn to the country's Gross Domestic Product. 
 
 New entrants in the e-commerce sector are taking advantage of the restrictions in movement to create a digital presence for their businesses and offer new services to customers. ""I used to be a housewife, I stopped working in 2017 after I had my first child but before then, I have always wanted to own my own business. “I have a lot of friends who sell hair or clothes on Instagram, so when the lockdown started and it was difficult to buy food items, that was when I thought of creating my shopping service,"" Blessing Ameh told SaharaReporters. Ameh, who now uses her car to serve as a personal shopper for some Lagosians during the lockdown, said she has been making enormous profit and plans to expand her services. Explaining how it works, she said, ""I created an Instagram page and asked people to send their shopping list to me. Then I go out and buy it as an essential service worker and I deliver it at a fee. “My customers are happy because it saves them time and they don't have to worry about contracting Coronavirus."" Emeka Okoli, who also lives in Lagos and owns two dispatch motorcycles, said business has been booming and he would like to expand as soon as possible. He said, ""To be honest with you, I work in a bank, so I'm financially literate. This for me at the beginning was to create multiple streams of income. I used to collaborate especially with Instagram vendors but now my client base has grown and demand is high. ""Now, people want to send my riders to pick up items for them and they are willing to pay because they are scared of going out. I am hoping to expand as soon as possible."" Website and app developers are also leveraging on the situation to offer their services. ""We used to design maybe one website a month, an app if we are lucky and even then clients don't pay on time. “Since the lockdown began, we have been working nonstop and the pay is usually upfront now. ""The designs are usually for new online shops or businesses who already exist but have to go online to survive. Everybody is online now,"" says Karo Dabo, team lead of an Abuja-based design company. While new opportunities are booming for urban dwellers as a result of the avenues presented by the Internet, rural dwellers are yet to fully enter the show as a result lack of electricity and disposable income to purchase smartphones to access the Internet. Notwithstanding, Nigerians from every corner of the country are daily finding their ways to the Internet to provide good and services to an increasingly available market created by the Coronavirus outbreak and attendant lockdown of most parts of the country. "
Exclusive,EXCLUSIVE: Chinese Restaurants Record Low Patronage In Lagos Over Coronavirus Fears,"2 Months Ago
",/2020/02/29/exclusive-chinese-restaurants-record-low-patronage-lagos-over-coronavirus-fears,"
 
 Chinese restaurants in Lagos have been recording low patronage since the outbreak of Coronavirus.  Managers and owners of such cuisine business in Lagos said patronage had dropped further after the confirmed case of the virus in the state on Friday morning by the Ministry of Health.  The patient, an Italian, was said to have entered the country through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, on February 24 aboard a Turkish Airline flight.  SaharaReporters had also exclusively reported how the Italian travelled to Ogun State and was smuggled back to Lagos 72 hours after he arrived in the country when he began showing signs of contracting the virus. He is currently being held at the Lagos State Biosecurity Hospital in Yaba.  However, news of the recorded index case had created panic among Nigerians, who feared the country might be unable to contain the spread of the pandemic despite assurances from the Nigerian Government to tackle the virus. As a result of the outbreak of the virus in China and confirmation of a case in Lagos, residents of the city, who used to patronise Chinese restaurants, have been refraining from doing so. 
 
 Manager of Zen Garden, a popular Chinese restaurant on Isaac John, a highbrow area of Ikeja, Moses Yakubu, told SaharaReporters that patronage has significantly dropped since the disease broke out in China in early January 2020.  “Today is Friday but the patronage is not like before, it has dropped so badly. ""We have been taking precautions since the disease broke out. “We have hand sanitisers everywhere. My staff also make sure they disinfect their hands before and after attending to customers."" In another restaurant visited by our correspondent, there was no single customer when SaharaReporters arrived at the place.  “It is the same even in China. Shops are closing down,” the owner said, adding that the low patronage was expected.  In the bid to alleviate the fears of Nigerians, who are majority of those patronising the cuisine operators, some restaurants are taking drastic measures.  Manager of New China Restaurant said nationals from China had been restricted from patronising them.  “Since the outbreak, we have stopped Chinese people from coming in here,” said the manager, who introduced himself as Paul Balogun.  On a Friday evening, peak hour for restaurants and hangout spots in Lagos, one of the workers was reading a newspaper at a corner. There was no customer to attend to.  The Lagos State Government tested some Chinese citizens for the virus earlier this week but they all tested negative for the virus.  Balogun said the management had to let go of workers as sales had drastically dropped.  “Some of my staff have been sacked. Some of them have been placed on compulsory leave. We are only five left here,” he told SaharaReporters.  There has been fear of global economy shrinkage as a result of the outbreak. Over the last week, there was a drop in crude oil prices and global stock market.  Since the outbreak in China, the virus has spread to 56 other countries with 2,867 deaths recorded.  At least 28 people, who had contact with the index case in Nigeria, had been quarantined in Ogun State. The World Health Organisation has called for calm and encouraged people to practice good hygiene amidst panic around the world of the virus spreading further."

 Some Supermarkets and stores in Akure, Ondo State, are now profiting heavily from the closure of popular mall, Shoprite, SaharaReporters can authoritatively report.  It was observed that impatient customers have begun seeking other means to purchase items in the state by approaching supermarkets and street stores in the city. Our correspondent, who visited several supermarkets across Akure on Thursday, discovered how customers were trooping in constantly to purchase various items. Though there have been complains by consumers over the cost of items in many of the supermarkets and stores visited by our correspondent, the crowd in those places did not reduce for the most part of the day. Manager of one of the stores in the city, Abimbola Chukwudi, told SaharaReporters that they indeed sales had increased for them since the Shoprite outlet in Akure was shut down. According to her, they were currently overwhelmed with the influx of customers and wish business can remain like this for them. She said, “We have been witnessing improved sales and high influx of customers in our store since Shoprite was shut down in Akure due to the protest by some youths. 
 
 “In fact, to withstand the large number of customers, we now open all doors to the supermarket so that customers can go in and out easily. “To be honest, we have been profiting from the closure of Shoprite and we are very happy about this.” It is the same story for Bimbo Adebakin whose supermarket in the city has also witnessed increased patronage. According to the middle-aged woman, since the closure of Shoprite, business had flourished so much that she had been smiling to the bank. “I have requested for two salesgirls to join the four people working at my supermarket at the moment because of the large volume of customers we have been recording since Shoprite was shut down, “Even customers that had forgotten us for a long time, they have started patronising us again. This is indeed a blessing in disguise for people like me,” she said. 
 
 In the other parts of Akure visited by SaharaReporters, it was a similar tale of job for supermarket and store owners, who said that the entire situation was a way God had used to prosper their businesses – many of which had come under severe threat of even extinction since the arrival of the South African company in the city. A customer, Iyabo Adebayo, told our correspondent that she has had to rely on supermarkets around her to purchase needed items since the closure of Shoprite in Akure. “Since Shoprite was shut down, we have to seek another means to buy our goods. “We have been getting every item need at many of these stores and that is why we are not really feeling the closure of the popular mall,” she said. The latest development comes barely two days after the Shoprite outlet was shut down over fears of an attack by youths protesting the killing of Nigerians and other African migrants in South Africa."
Corruption,Nigerian Students On Scholarship Abroad Risk Deportation Over Refusal Of Nigerian Government To Pay Tuition Fees,"1 Month Ago
",/2020/04/01/nigerian-students-scholarship-abroad-risk-deportation-over-refusal-nigerian-government,"
 
 Not less than 210 Nigerian, who are beneficiaries of the Niger Delta Development Commission 2019 Scholarship programme, are at risk of deportation as the Nigerian Government has refused to make payment for their tuition fees. In July 2019, the NDDC under the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, announced its annual scholarship scheme calling for applications from all Niger Deltans. “As part of our Human Resource Development initiatives, NDDC is embarking on Post Graduate Foreign Scholarship Programme to equip Niger Deltans with relevant training and skills for effective participation in the Local Content programme of the current Administration as well as compete globally in various professional fields,” the notice read. The successful persons were selected after a Computer Based Test and sent to different schools abroad with many in the United Kingdom. They were invited for a briefing where an award letter was given to them. Little did they know that they would be left stranded by the commission and ministry, the same fate suffered by beneficiaries of past years. SaharaReporters had in July 2019 exclusively reported how two persons from the 2018 scholarship programme were deported and over 100 at risk of deportation due to the non-payment of their tuition fees. 
 
 After SaharaReporters’ story, the commission swiftly paid the fees of some selected persons while others were abandoned.  Months after the 2019 election, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Akpabio as NDDC Minister and ordered a forensic audit of the account of the commission due to various corrupt activities.  Akpabio, on his part, vowed to change the situation in the NDDC but since that period nothing significant had been seen. Also, the scholarship scheme is also heading the usual way as the agency has again abandoned and left beneficiaries stranded in different countries. Some of the affected persons, who spoke with SaharaReporters, disclosed that the NDDC was yet to make any payment to them, eight months after winning the scholarship. While many of them travelled on their own expenses with an assurance of getting refund but the commission has failed to fulfill that promise. 
 
 “The 2019 scholarship was awarded in July 2019. Till date, over 210 students are in schools all over the world and the NDDC has not paid a dime of the school fees or even the living cost. “We can't work where we are, we have no funds at all and the government that sent us here is ignoring us. It is getting dire and NDDC is saying they are closing. “They haven't even paid the N10,000 thank you for coming to the briefing, the N500,000 pre-departure fee has not been paid and the registration fees into the universities. “It's been eight months of being in the UK for most people without a dime,” one of the beneficiaries of the 2019 scholarship programme said. Some letters sighted by our correspondent revealed that some of the universities where the beneficiaries are learning are beginning to terminate their programme while others have also began processes to have them deported. Currently, some beneficiaries have been logged out of their school portal. “I am emailing to inform you that your sponsorship for Niger Delta has been removed, we have not received any replies from chasing them and no payment, you are now responsible for the fees of £175,000, you will receive a statement in the post next week. “This is a reminder that you have not yet completed the registration process with the university. This should have been completed within the first four weeks of your start date. “The impact of the removal of the scholarship is that if the scholar doesn't pay within 30 days, the scholar's access to school facilities would be terminated and in another 30 days may be reported to the home office for action, including deportation,” some of the letters sent to the beneficiaries read. 
 
 The affected persons have now expressed fear of being deported any moment from now and urged government to swiftly begin payment process. A few days ago, the NDDC announced the immediate closure of its operation due to the outbreak of Coronavirus in Nigeria. The NDDC also said it will be committing over N1bn to assist the nine states of the Niger Delta region in the fight against the pandemic. Meanwhile, in a recent interview, Acting Managing Director of the NDDC, Prof Kemebradikumo Pondei, pledged the commitment of the commission to the terms and conditions of its post-graduate foreign scholarship programme, saying it would meet all obligations to beneficiaries. He said, “We are obliged to meet all the terms of the scholarship because we cannot send people out of the country and not pay their fees.”  "

The document dated December 30, 2019, stated that the payment was released on the orders of the Lagos Assembly Speaker. “Payment approved as Estacode to the Rt. Hon.

The students, who are mostly studying in the United Kingdom, currently risk being deported to Nigeria while their academic program are terminated. SaharaReporters gathered that the commission is yet to pay departure fee, registration fee as well as tuition of beneficiaries of the scholarship. Some of the affected persons told SaharaReporters that the commission said the outbreak of Coronavirus was hindering the processing of the funds. ""The excuse NDDC is giving is that the lockdown was affecting payment as they need to physically be in CBN to implement the process. ""A scholar will soon be thrown out of his accommodation because he doesn't have money to continue payment. ""The hope of the directive given by the MD has now been dashed as the representative of the commission recently updated us in our official Telegram platform that though the entire paperwork and approval had been completed, the NDDC was not able to transmit the hard copies to the CBN for payment due to the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown,"" one of the beneficiaries said. A staff of the commission, who asked not to be named, said the fund was with the Central Bank of Nigeria for processing and payment. The stranded students are urging the Nigerian Government to direct the CBN to immediately process and disburse the funds to them to prevent the termination of their academic programmes and eventual deportation from the United Kingdom.  "

   Some concerned stakeholders of the University of Lagos have asked the Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to proceed on immediate leave over his role in the crisis that had rocked the institution in recent times. On March 5, 2020, the university announced the suspension of its 51st convocation after a disagreement between the management and Pro Chancellor of the institution, Dr Wale Babalakin. Shortly afterwards, Chairman of UNILAG’s Academic Staff Union of Universities, Dr Wale Ashiru, addressed journalists and thereafter declared that Babalakin should no longer be seen within the school’s campus in Akoka. But reacting to the crisis, the concerned stakeholders in a statement on Saturday said, “We, the Concerned Stakeholders of the University of Lagos, comprising staff, old students, parents and students, have finally been vindicated on the current state of impunity and lawlessness which is actively backed by the university's ASUU leadership on our darling campus. “When the university council under the leadership of Dr Wale Babalakin sought to call management to order from its avowed path of financial recklessness, outright departure and flagrance disobedience to the university's edict, it was bullied and accused of seeking to hijack the authority of the Vice Chancellor. “But the sequence of events as recorded by the council minutes and relayed in the latest edition of Campus News leading to the tragedy of postponing the university's 2019 convocation, has exposed the unrelenting path of insanity and lawlessness embarked upon by the management as cheered on by ASUU leadership. “To make things worse, UNILAG ASUU Chairman, Dr Dele Ashiru, addressed a press conference in which among other misrepresentations of the truth of what transpired, went ahead to take the laws into his hand by threatening the life of the Pro Chancellor and forbidding him from further stepping on the campus. “We hereby alert the Inspector-General of the Nigerian Police and Director-General of the Department of State Services to take urgent steps to pre-empt the UNILAG ASUU Chairman from carrying out his avowed criminal intentions of preventing the Pro Chancellor from carrying out his lawful duties on campus as Council Chairman. “In order not to hold our 2019 graduands to further strain and for the university to move on; we advise the relevant authorities to advise the Vice Chancellor to proceed on immediate leave while a Deputy Vice Chancellor should be allowed to take over in an acting capacity to lay a detailed plan and new date for the 2019 convocation ceremonies before the council for scrutiny and approval.”"

Police,Civil Society Organisations Accuse President Buhari Of Breaching Federal Character Principle In Constituting Police Trust Fund Board,"7 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/civil-society-organisations-accuse-president-buhari-breaching-federal-character-principle,"Some civil society organisations in Nigeria have accused President Muhammadu Buhari of breaching federal character in his appointment of trustees to the Nigeria Police Trust Fund. The CSO's in a joint statement on Saturday wondered why Buhari would appoint a former Inspector-General of Police to head the board when there were other competent Nigerians with financial and management experience available for such role. It said, ""The appointment of retired Inspector-General of Police, Suleiman Abba, as Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, and the appointment of Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto as the Executive Secretary of the Board breach the Federal Character Principle and Law. 
 
 ""They both come from the same geopolitical zone. The penchant by successive presidents to appoint retired IGPs to head institutions or mechanisms simply because they have to do with the police has proved to be a misguided and costly mistake. Is being a former IGP the only criteria or qualification for appointment as Chairman of the Trust Fund? How well has the Police Service Commission fared under successive retired IGPs as Chairmen?  ""A Trust Fund needs to be chaired by an experienced private sector administrator with integrity and expertise in financial management. It also needs to be insulated from politics and bureaucracy.” The CSO's therefore called on President Buhari to review the composition of the Trust Fund to ensure that it complies with the requirements of the law particularly the Federal Character Principle.

",/2020/05/17/coronavirus-nafdac-fast-track-lab-analysis-madagascar-herbal-drug,"The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has promised to fast-track the laboratory examination of the herbal drug from Madagascar to fight Coronavirus, a report by Sunday PUNCH has said. The agency said that the product would be subjected to the normal procedure but that the process would be fast-tracked. NAFDAC’s Director of Public Relations, Dr Abubakar Jimoh, who spoke on behalf of the agency’s Director-General, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, noted that the organisation would prioritise the laboratory examination of the product once it received it from the authorities. 
 
 He said, “When the drug arrives, it will go to the Minister of Health who will in turn hand it over to NAFDAC through the PTF. It is after that we would start our laboratory examination. It will be subjected to the normal procedure. “We would expedite action on this because everyone is anxiously waiting for the result. We would speed it up but it will still have to go through the normal laboratory analysis and medical evaluation. “Unlike the orthodox medicine, with the herbal medicine, it is given linctus status, it is not given full registration and that means it has a life span of two years, unlike normal drug that has a life span of five years.  “So, this is what will be applicable to the Madagascar drug. We would ensure that the claims being made are true.” When asked how long it could take for the laboratory examination to be concluded, he said the normal procedure was three months but that given the situation at hand, the process would be prioritised without compromising the efficiency of the process. He said, “The normal mandatory procedure is three months but under this emergency, we would give it a top priority to come out with urgent results. In the process of the evaluation, if NAFDAC needs to get in touch with the manufacturers we will. It all depends on the analysis in the lab. “This kind of drug does not go through a clinical trial at this stage; it is only when it wants to go through registration that it will be subjected to clinical trial. We are only going to determine its safety and efficacy now.”  "
CRIME,French Police Arrest Africa's Most Wanted Man In Paris Over Rwandan Genocide,"6 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/french-police-arrest-africas-most-wanted-man-paris-over-rwandan-genocide,"One of the most wanted fugitives in Rwanada's 1994 genocide has been arrested outside Paris, France, today, according to Daily Mail.  Felicien Kabuga, 84, who had a £4m bounty on his head, had been accused of equipping ethnic Hutu extremists in the 100-day genocide that killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.    Kabuga, once one of Rwanda's richest men, was living under a false identity in a town North of Paris, Asnieres-sur-Seine, the public prosecutor's office and police said in a joint statement. 
 
 The 84-year-old fugitive, who has been wanted by the judicial authorities for 25 years, was found when agents swooped on his house at dawn.  The head of France's agency for fighting crimes against humanity, Eric Emeraux, said the chase had been renewed two months ago after new intelligence emerged. He had been hiding in the suburbs with the complicity of his children and is believed to have previously spent time in Germany, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Switzerland.  Olivier Olsen, head of the association of homeowners in the building where he lived in France, said Kabuga had lived there for three to four years and described him as 'someone very discreet who murmured when you said hello.' In 1997, Kabuga was indicted by the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on charges related to conspiracy to commit genocide, persecution and extermination. He was accused of using his wealth and influence during the genocide to funnel money to militia groups as chairman of the Fonds de Defense Nationale fund. Rwandan prosecutors said financial documents found in the country's capital, Kigali, after the genocide indicated he had used his companies to import large quantities of machetes which were used to slaughter people.    The wealthy businessman was also accused of establishing the notorious station, Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines, that broadcast vicious propaganda against the ethnic Tutsi and incited people to carry out murder. He was also indicted for training and equipping the Interahamwe militia that led to the killing spree. The Rwanda tribunal formally closed in 2015 and its duties have since been taken over by the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, which also deals with cases left over from the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
 
 Serge Brammertz, Chief Prosecutor of the MICT in The Hague, Netherlands, said, “The arrest of Felicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even 26 years after their crimes.” The fugitive will now appear before French prosecutors who should order him to be remanded in custody. Judicial authorities can then rule on sending him to The Hague to face justice. He is expected to be tried at the MICT's branch in Arusha in Tanzania but it is likely his transfer to UN custody will take some time because of the Coronavirus pandemic.  Mausi Segun, Africa Director at Human Rights Watch, said his arrest was “an important step towards justice for hundreds of thousands of genocide victims”. "

Economy,Nigerian Government Dependent On Expensive Borrowing –IMF,"7 Months Ago

 The International Monetary Fund has said that Nigeria’s “over-Optimistic” revenue assumptions has made the government dependent on expensive borrowing from the Central Bank of Nigeria. The IMF stated that plans to increase Value Added Tax and minimum wage would also halt the current deceleration of the country’s inflation rate. A statement by the IMF said, “Over-optimistic revenue projections have led to higher financing needs than initially envisaged, resulting in over-reliance on the expensive borrowing from the central bank to finance the deficit. “Inflation will likely pick up in 2020 following rising minimum wages and a higher VAT rate, despite a tight monetary policy.” In the spending plan for 2020 released by President Muhammadu Buhari, the government intends to increase the present value added tax rate by 50 per cent from its present five per cent. This will force Nigerians to pay more for goods and services, leading to an increase in the rate at which prices will rise in the coming year. While noting that Nigeria’s economy was recovering slowly after a 2016 recession, the IMF stated that bigger deficits make monetary policy complex owing to the government’s reliance on the CBN for funding.   "

Opinion,It’s A Lie: Igboland Is Not Landlocked By Aloy Ejimakor,"9 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/it%E2%80%99s-lie-igboland-not-landlocked-aloy-ejimakor,"It’s often said that a lie told so many times, if unchallenged, may - in course of time - begin to pass for the truth. One of such is the terrible lie, institutionally purveyed since the end of the Civil War, to the effect that Igboland is landlocked or that it has no access to the sea. The purpose of this essay, therefore, is to debunk that lie with some simple historical and topographical evidence that are even in plain view, if you care to dig or do some physical exploration of your own. Suffice it to say that it is a profound tragedy that entire generations of the immediate post-War Igbos never bordered to check but seemingly accepted this brazen institutional falsehood, largely intended to taunt the Igbo and put them down. A few that knew it to be false just didn’t care anymore. That History was banned since the end of the Civil War made it worse, plus the fact that most people don’t take physical Geography that serious anymore, otherwise they would have known that Abia, Imo and Anambra States have varying short-distance paths to the Atlantic Ocean through Imo, Azumiri and Niger Rivers. It’s not really rocket science, as you can easily confirm this if you know how to read Google Earth; or conquer your fear of swamp snakes and walk through these areas on foot. 
 
 There are also many other hardly explored waterways and slithering tributaries, including the remote reaches of Oguta Lake and Oseakwa River in Ihiala (Imo State) that meandered through Igbo-delta wetlands to the Southeastern ends of the Atlantic waterfront. These rivers have varying lengths of short navigational paths to the Atlantic, and in some cases, are far shorter nautically (and even on footpath) than the Portharcourt, Calabar and Ibaka seaports are to their side of the Atlantic. Many of these pathways, including particularly the ones from the outer reaches of Imo and Azumiri Rivers terminate at the Atlantic at no more than 15 to 30 Nautical miles to the beachhead. To put it in lay language, one nautical mile equals 1.8 kilometers. Thus, the contiguity of Southeast (not even the greater Igboland) to the Atlantic is less nautical miles than the Atlantic is to the seaports in Calabar, Onne, Ibaka, Lagos and Portharcourt. If you discount the territories excised from Igboland during State creations and the damnable boundary adjustments, it will be far less. To be sure, Ikwerre land or Igweocha which bears the greater portions of the Portharcourt seaport was dredged up to 50 miles to the Atlantic front through the Bonny River. Onne seaport was dredged up to 60 Miles to the Atlantic and Calabar seaport was dredged 45 nautical miles to the Atlantic. Ibaka seaport is about 30 nautical miles to the Atlantic and the Lagos seaports dredged up to about 50 nautical miles to the Atlantic. Compare all these to Obuaku in Abia State, which is only 25 nautical miles to the Atlantic from the confluence of Imo and Azumiri River which itself separately lies not more than 30 nautical miles to the Atlantic beachfront. The less obvious one is the little-known Oseakwa River in Ihiala (Imo State) which is mere 18 nauticals to the Atlantic, all with its 65 feet of natural depth, unarguably comparable to no other River in Nigeria. Additionally, what is geopolitically known as Igboland today is far smaller than what it was and legally supposed to be. As far back as 1856, Baikie - one of the earliest and credible Geographers of ancient Nigeria, had this to say - “Igbo homeland, extends east and west, from the Old Kalabar river to the banks of the Kwora, Niger River, and possesses also some territory at Aboh, an Igbo clan, to the west-ward of the latter stream. On the north it borders on Igara, Igala and A'kpoto, and it is separated from the sea only by petty tribes, all of which trace their origin to this great race"" (Baikie, William Balfour, published with a sanction of Her Majesty's Government in 1856). But with that infamous post-War abandoned property policy and the egregious institutional injustices in boundary adjustments and the widespread anti-Igbo gerrymandering, Igbos physically and psychologically lost their vested ancestral lands, all to the point of not caring anymore about their historical contiguity to the Atlantic, which their ancestors beheld and called the ‘Great Sea’. The psychological beat-down got so bad that some of the descendants of these Igbo ancestors (nearest to the Atlantic and now lying outside Southeast) are no longer sure whether they are Igbo or not. The worst injustice was In 1976 when the Justice Nasir Boundary Adjustment Commission made a serious and targeted agenda of carving out core Igboland territories into some neighboring States of the South-South. But they didn’t quite make an absolute success of it. They missed the southernmost Southeast lands that possess Rivers that meandered through slices of Igbo-friendly South-South territories and ended up at the Atlantic, thus unwittingly placing Igboland and its right of access to the sea under the canons of customary international law. As it stands, international law of the sea guarantees Igboland (whether it remains Nigerian territory or not) unhindered access to the nearest sea (in this case: the Atlantic) peacefully by the many short-distance rivers, waterways and tributaries that originated from Igboland but ultimately washed into the Atlantic through contiguous South-South territories. For avoidance of doubt, there’s particularly the Obuaku confluence in Ukwa West (Abia State) that flows through Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom State before expanding out and washing into the near-reaches of the Atlantic. And the River Niger which ultimately joined the Atlantic through a vast network of hardly explored creeks and mangrove swamps that abut the Bight of Bonny in the South-South. Nigeria is subject to the International Law of the Sea and is therefore bound to abide by its provisions, should the need arise in a scenario of persistent sovereign oppression of an identifiable indigenous group. The others are the United Nations Treaty of the Sea and the African Union Treaties and Conventions on the Sea, including particularly the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights, which Nigeria ratified and domesticated in 1983. The pertinent provisions are mostly embedded in the copious provisions relating to the collective economic and commercial rights of indigenous peoples lying within the Treaty nations. Ndigbo are undoubtedly an indigenous people presently lying within Nigeria. So, international law will surely come into play if a conflict arises out of Nigeria’s persistent institutional resistance to granting a seaport to Igboland."

The school fixed April 27 for resumption of academic activities, adding that only those, who pay fees would be allowed to attend classes. In a letter by the Managing Director, Mrs I.O.

The first half has been discounted considering there are some services we will not be rendering during the lockdown, like feeding, club and other activities. “It is hoped that the lockdown order will be repealed before the mid-term, hence the full 50 per cent fees payment for the second half of the term. “Should the lockdown continue, however, the same discount applies. Please note also, that there is an additional discount on the total bill for any parent who pays the entire fees for the term on resumption. “Once the school fees are paid, a password will be generated for the learners to log into the online school.” However, Irked by the move of the school, aggrieved parents have accused the management of Chrisland of acted insensitively especially following the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in the country and other parts of the world. One angry parent, whose sentiments was shared by others, said, “The management of Chrisland Schools may be shopping for trouble and heading for possible fracas with us judging by a recent letter the Managing Director of the school, Mrs. I.O. Adeyemi, dispatched to us. “Chrisland management did not consider the fact that nobody envisaged the lockdown, which is also an indication that some parents may not have the required gadgets and infrastructure to enable their wards prepare for the examination. We will not accept this.” Most state governments across Nigeria had announced the closure of schools to help curb the spread of the pandemic, hinting recently that there is no date in sight yet for resumption due to the continued spread of the virus."

The statement reads, “The minister needs to understand that e-learning is not the same as computer vending and supplies. It is not as simple as computerisation, supplying of computers and accessories, or simply connecting institutions to the Internet. “The production of power points slides and accessing MOOCS of overseas university is not e-learning. “Online learning is a type of e-learning that depends entirely on Internet-based resources and support system. It requires certain behavioural changes and regulatory adjustments in order to make it work for the learner. It cannot be established by mere ministerial directive and bureaucratic fiat but through careful and detailed planning, funding and training by those involved. None of these have been done in Nigeria. “There is no Nigerian university today that is operating any form or model of e-learning because of poor Internet access, high bandwidth costs and irregular power supply. On what infrastructure does the minister expect the online delivery to run? “Online learning depends critically on an effective library system, with online resources and seamless access from across the globe. “No Nigerian library, including the National Library has a semblance of a kindergarten library in serious countries. “There is no single university in Nigeria today that operates a mix-mode system. This is when students have option to take courses online or face to face. “To seek to transit therefore to online delivery will amount to taking a plunge. We believe that as usual, contractors have cornered the government and have seen a business opportunity. While civil servants are once more using COVID-19 as a reason to defraud government. “The Nigerian university system had been defrauded for many years by federal agencies who dump substandard computers in universities from time to time at the end of the year to justify last minute plundering of national resources in the name of supporting e-learning.”  "

The director of FCT has also opened a portal for the process “We are working with the Ministry of Information to escalate education content to provide for everyone at home. “Our biggest challenge is to reach children who do not have devices but we are working with radio corporations to instil some of that for primary and secondary students.”  "
PUBLIC HEALTH,"UNILAG Medical Students Yet To Be Inducted Seven Months After Graduation Despite Being Forced To Pay N80,000 Each","1 Week Ago
",/2020/05/05/unilag-medical-students-yet-be-inducted-seven-months-after-graduation-despite-being,"Medical students at the University of Lagos have expressed concerns over the unwarranted delay in their induction into medical profession despite fulfilling all requirements.  A graduand, who spoke with SaharaReporters on condition of anonymity, claimed that all fees have been paid but the management has kept giving excuses for the delay.  He added that when probed too much, the management give unrealistic dates for their induction. 
 
 He said, “The Provost of the College of Medicine granted an interview recently claiming Nigeria was in short supply of the workforce to combat the ongoing pandemic. This is laughable especially when there are over 100 of us both in Medicine and Dentistry waiting endlessly for an induction seven months after we completed our studies.  ""There was a time we lodged our compliant to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria and the personnel, who responded, told us that the delay was that they were yet to certify us on character. That sounded and still sounds very strange.”  Another aggrieved graduand, who spoke with our correspondent, said they were tired of the situation.  He said, “We laboured for this degree, underwent the unthinkable. What exactly is the excuse of Prof Afolabi Lesi, the Provost, for not inducting us? This is after paying a compulsory sum of N80,000 induction fee.  ""They cannot tell us that this is caused by the pandemic because we should have done this long before now. They can even issue temporary licenses to those who have got jobs at the moment or send to our mails. It’s not rocket science.  ""As we are now, we can not practise. No jobs. Many of us are just stranded, wasting away instead of putting our training into professional practice especially at this crucial time in the world.” Provost of the college and other senior officials could not be reached for comments at the time of this report.  Recall that in 2017, SaharaReporters reported the infrastructural decay and corruption at the college, which pushed students to pay bills of patients they treated all in a bid to meet up with procedures and qualify to sit exams."

",/2020/05/06/covid-19-poverty-lack-stable-power-supply-robbing-us-e-lectures-%E2%80%93indigent-nigerian,"The Coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria has seen schools shut their gates to students as part of measures to stop the spread. While schools in France, United States of America and China have moved lessons online, students in Nigeria affected by factors such as poverty, lack of stable electricity supply and unable to afford Internet connectivity appears to have been left to their fate. According to Josiah Magaji, a school principal in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the outbreak of the virus and its impact of the economy of the country has compounded the miseries of children from indigent homes. 
 
 He said, ""It's going to have a big impact on the attendance of schools even after everything is over. We used to struggle with out-of-school children who are poor and need to trek long kilometres to get to school. ""Some of these kids, their parents prefer for them to farm or hawk to travellers going to Kano. We used initiatives such as school feeding and scholarships to lure the in the past but I can tell you now that it would be difficult to bring most of them back. Some might have even married."" Even though states like Lagos through its Ministry of Education have taken steps to deliver lessons via radio and television to students within the state, intended beneficiaries say it has not been enough. ""There is usually no light in my estate and we only put on the generator at night, so it's difficult for me to follow the lessons,"" Says Esther Augustine, a JSS3 pupil, who attends a government school in Ikeja. ""I have heard of people attending lectures online but I don't have an iPad, my cousin in Canada told me she attends classes online with her own. I want to do same too online, so I want the Lagos State governor to make it happen,"" she said. Tertiary institution students also affected by the above-mentioned factors, say they struggle to cope with the demands of learning without the enabling environment. A 100-level student of the University of Abuja, who only wants to be identified as Okeke, told SaharaReporters on Wednesday that she was finding it difficult to study at home and understand hard topics because she had no guidance. She said, ""It hasn't been easy at all because we have to research on our own since we don't have online classes and we don't have guidance on particularly difficult topics. ""It has been tough and we are expected to write exams when school resumes especially 100 level students who just resumed.”  "

",/2020/05/08/unilag-medical-students-college-medicine-management-disagree-over-delayed-induction-seven,"Medical students of the University of Lagos yet to be inducted after graduating from medical college have disagreed with management of the college for delaying a proposed “virtual induction” by the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria. While the students favour the virtual ceremony to finally make it possible for them to start practicing as medical professionals more than seven months after they completed their time at the College of Medicine at Idi-Araba, they accused the Provost, Prof Afolabi Lesi, of wanting a physical and elaborate event at a yet to be announced date.  Recall that SaharaReporters had reported how medical students at the college expressed concerns over the unwarranted delay in their induction into medical profession despite fulfilling all requirements.

While speaking on the latest development on Friday, one of the affected medical students said, “All Prof Afolabi, the Provost, wants is party, which is very unnecessary at this time. “This is an induction that does not last two hours. It is not true that they are in talks with MDCN for a virtual induction. If that was the case, MDCN would do it the next day. “If he (Prof Afolabi Lesi) wants to release us for induction, from the information we have gathered, the council would get it done with immediate effect. “This is a very crucial period. The reason for the protracted delay cannot be unconnected with several racketeering going on, on the said induction day ceremony. We are not commodities please. Nigeria needs us.”  The affected persons have vowed to embark on a protest soon if the induction was not conducted by the college’s management."
Opinion,Propaganda Made And Un-made Saraki By Abdulrazaq Hamzat,"9 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/propaganda-made-and-un-made-saraki-abdulrazaq-hamzat,"Media, they often say, is like a double-edged sword that can make and unmake any individual. To underscore the importance of this maxim, one only needs to look at the political rise and fall of Nigeria’s former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki. Within the space of 2 decades, Bukola Saraki rose to the zenith of his political career as Nigeria’s senate president, from the obscurity of his father’s collapsed bank, Society Générale, to being a presidential assistant, then a two term Governor, a Governor’s governor (Chairman Governor’s Forum), a two term senator and Senate President of Federal Republic of Nigeria, before going down to become nothing, after crushing his father’s dynasty, just like he crushed the bank, Society Generale. 
 
 Like the proverbial la la, in the Yoruba adage, ‘’la la to ro ke’’, Bukola Saraki went up, as high as propaganda could take him, then came down, as low as la la could bring him. After all, la la to ro ke (la la that went up), ile lon bo (will surely come down).  In 2019 general election, the same propaganda, which made Dr Saraki and helped him retain firm grip on the destiny of Kwara State for almost two decades, finally unmade the former Senate President, serving him a very small dose of his own meal. While some beneficiaries of the dynasty are still saving face by holding unto the crushed brand like an orphan holding tight to the corps of his or her guardian, his organizers, especially the media handlers may never recover from the numerous media punches that the otoge warriors pounced into their skulls during that campaign that untie the knot of the several decades old dynasty. In their disturbed mind, despite the huge investment made by Saraki in media propaganda and claim of expertise in media strategy by his over bloated media men, it is the same media communication that ousted their man, but in my own mind, which they wouldn’t say, it is media propaganda that made him in the first place and If that is the case, let us just agree that media propaganda made and unmade him and there’s no need to keep crying over a broken egg. See, i have often say that, media is a system that can make Jesus look like Satan and make Satan look like Jesus, in such a way that, when people see Jesus, they will run away and say, I rebuke you in the name of Jesus, and when they see Satan, they will bow to him and say, son of God, you are our lord and personal savior.  This is so because, no matter how good you are, media has the capacity to paint you as evil and no matter how evil, you can be portrayed as saint. However, If media paint an evil person as saint yesterday, he shouldn’t be too joyous because today, it could repaint him or her back to its real self. Let me also add that, media has a way of making the small look big and the big small. This is a tool for psychological warfare and the dominance of Saraki in Kwara State for many years is largely due to this media propaganda. In Kwara State, we know of the many media personnel, who work for national newspapers, but draw salary from Kwara State as media consultants to the dynasty. I am also aware of some online influencers who are on the payroll of the former ruling dynasty across the federation.  This is apart from those who simply enjoy occasional patronage without retainship. However, the Saraki propaganda is beyond that of the media alone. In actual fact, it is all encompassing. This is how it works. You wake up in the morning and turned on your radio station. The story blasting out from your speaker will be a Saraki planted story, whether relevant or irrelevant, newsworthy or otherwise. On Television station, every Saraki story, whether news worthy or not is given huge prominence and the people are forced to consume this content over and over again until they come to accept whatever is being said. Remember that for a long time, there were no private media platforms in Kwara State until very recently. The emergence of vibrant alternative sources of information largely liberalized the space. Again, when you go to religious places to pray, the imam is asking you to pray for the leader, which of course was Saraki. Then in the traditional circle, you grow in rank and influence based on your loyalty to Saraki dynasty and even the student union leadership would be decided based on loyalty to Saraki and same with the civil service. This practice is also extended to trade unions, markets and community association in such a way that almost everywhere you turn, Saraki will be staring at you in the face. It became practically impossible to escape from Saraki’s hold, until the liberalization of the media space, first through online media, then to radio and others. At the national level, Saraki handlers are very alert and responsive. They understand how social media operates and they are well equipped and empowered to respond appropriately.  Almost all prominent social media platforms are on the payroll of the handlers. This ensures a prominent feature of their planted stories across the media, both conventional and social. They also have a large team of social media influencers that help syndicate their content across all platforms and of course, they pay well. So, when this was understood, it was easy to make their job difficult, by changing the narrative completely. At first, they were matched information for information, then they were taken out of their comfort zone to a whole new turf, from which they continue to suffer until they were outpaced and completely lost control.  To say it differently, Saraki’s propaganda was basically rendered impotent and he lost it long before the election. In conclusion, let me say, to the remnant of the Saraki dynasty, especially those in the media space that continue to bore the public with one claim or the other, about how propaganda was used to dethrone their overlord, please grow up. Ile ti mo, its day break."

 The Federal Polytechnic, Ado Ekiti, has confirmed the death of two workers of the institution who were electrocuted on Monday. The institution’s Public Relations Officer, Adeyemi Adejolu, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ado-Ekiti on Tuesday that the two staff of the Department of Works died while effecting the repair of a borehole. “I can confirm that they got electrocuted while performing their duties. It was a sad and regrettable incident,” he said. Adejolu said the corpse of one of the deceased, an indigene of Kogi, had already been taken to his town for burial, while the family of the other deceased, a native of Ado-Ekiti, had been contacted. Sources at the institution said the victims met their untimely death while working on a borehole and were in the process of removing the galvanized pipes when the accident occurred. “As they were removing the pipes, they did not know that it had gone up to the extent that it could touch a high tension wire around the area. Immediately the pipe touched the high tension wire, there was a huge spark that caused electrocution of the two men. “Their bodies were charred by the effect of the electrocution while other support workers did not sustain any injury,’’ the source said. When contacted, DSP Sunday Abutu, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, said he had yet to be briefed on the accident and would do so when availed with the facts of the case."

",/2020/05/14/laspotech-employees-urge-lagos-governor-not-appoint-allies-outgoing-rector,"Lecturers and other members of staff of the Lagos State Polytechnic have urged Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to appoint a rector that will command the loyalty and respect of all stakeholders in the polytechnic. In a joint press statement by the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics, and Non-Academic Staff Union in LASPOTECH, they said it will be suicidal to appoint allies of the outgoing rector, Samuel Oluyinka Sogunro. The statement reads, “These joy and happiness were with us before the coming of the present rector, Samuel Oluyinka Sogunro, whose antecedents is characterised by students harassment, hatred for staff that are not his friend and penchant for diabolism.  “He became rector because of his friendliness to powers that be in government and his diabolical pursuit of the position. If there had been a governing council during the time of his appointment, Sogunro could never have been LASPOTECH rector. 
 
 “We want to categorically affirm that he would never have been our rector if stakeholders in the polytechnic had been involved in the process. This is the reason the unions as stakeholders are lending our voice in the current appointment of the next rector of LASPOTECH. “We also had to be involved because there is the utmost need to prevent the re-emergence of the prevailing travail in the next dispensation which may be brought about by appointing a wrong and unacceptable person to manage the polytechnic affairs in the next five years. The unions are passionate about preventing a repeat of the turmoil associated with Sogunro’s administration in the polytechnic. “We are privy to the fact that some of the applicants for the position of rector are part of Sogunro’s administration. These are Metilelu Olumide, the current deputy rector (Academics) and Senayon Nurudeen, the immediate-past deputy rector (Academics). These two applicants are integral part of the maladministration of Sogunro’s tenure. “It will be suicidal to give these Sogunro’s compatriots any iota of consideration on their applications. The unions do not expect them to scale the first hurdle in the process. Any mistake of appointing any one of the two will bring final doom on the polytechnic.” The three unions further advised the governor not to appoint someone outside the polytechnic sector as it will limit the career advancement of eligible academics in the institution."
LABOR/WORKERS' RIGHTS,Lockdown: Private Schools Teachers In Ondo Groan Over Unpaid Salaries As Employers Blame Coronavirus For Revenue Cut,"3 Days Ago

 As schools across the country remain closed due to the Coronavirus outbreak, some teachers in private schools in Ondo State have continued to lament the non-payment of their salaries by their employers. Some teachers working with private schools, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said their employers had been using the opportunity of the lockdown to deny them their salaries. They noted that even though many of the pupils already paid their school fees, the owners of the schools were not willing to pay them their salaries. The teachers added that many schools were almost rounding off the session before the government declared the shutdown of academic institutions. Mrs Yemi Adelaja, a teacher in one of the private schools in Ondo, said ever since schools were shut, she had not been paid any money by the owner of the school where she works. Another teacher, Mr Olamide Ayokunle, said the proprietor of the school where he teaches the English Language had asked them to stay at home. He revealed that since then, he and other teachers in private schools had begun home lessons for students for a fee as a way of survival. ""It's from this home lesson that we get some stipends to feed our family since the proprietors are no longer paying us. ""At least, I received weekly pay from some of the parents that I teach their children,"" he said. Another teacher, Bimbo Olamide, said she had to resign last week at one of the private schools in Owo after the owner could no longer pay them. She explained that she had started a small business in front of her house from the little savings she had just to survive. She observed that while those in government schools were being paid, the ones in private schools were home without pay. She said, ""For instance, in my school, the owner has been using Coronavirus as an excuse not to pay us. ""We know children are no longer coming to school as a result of the lockdown but what about the school fees they had paid earlier."" Olamide however, begged the government and individuals in the society to come to their aid by extending palliatives to them. One private school owner in Akure, who spoke with SaharaReporters, Mr Hakeem Adebusuyi, blamed the whole situation on the lockdown in the country, noting that some of the teachers were still being paid half salaries. He revealed that some schools had continued to give out soft loans to their teachers to survive until things get back to normal. According to President of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, Derick Ijidakinro, the issue of salary payment between the teachers and owners of schools should be a private arrangement. Ijidakinro explained that he had held meetings with some of the proprietors and the excuses they gave were that the Coronavirus outbreak disrupted their plans. He said, ""The truth is that even as at the time schools were being shut, many students and pupils were yet to pay their fees and some only paid half of their fees. “Private school proprietors are also helping the government in one way or the other to decongest the labour market and unemployment in the town. ""Our prayer is that the Coronavirus pandemic should just go away.”"

",/2020/05/15/almajiris-are-breeding-ground-coronavirus-says-governor-ganduje,"Almajiris have been described as the breeding ground for Coronavirus by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State because of their vulnerability as a result of lack of hygiene, lack of shelter and lack of proper sanitation. Ganduje stated this on Thursday at the opening of training for a special Rapid Response Team to cater for over 2000 Almajirai stationed at three mega centres in Kiru, Karaye and Gabasawa in Kano. “Because they stay in a congested environment, they have no defined place for them to sleep, no prescribed food for them to eat, no provision for sanitation and therefore they are vulnerable,” the governor was quoted by Vanguard newspapers. 
 
 Based on these, Ganduje decided to pay special attention to them by establishing the special response team to examine and protect them under the climate of COVID-19.  According to the governor, those found to be negative will be taken back to their parents while those found to be positive will be retained, isolated and treated. When they recover, they will then be taken back to their states with certification from the NCDC. He said, “We decided to examine all the Almajiris in Kano state. Our intention is to protect them and those who are negative, we take them back to their parents, back to their states to ensure that they are free from coronavirus. Those who are positive, we are not taking them back to their states of origin. We are putting them in isolation centres until they are cured and are confirmed negative.
 
  “For those Almajiris from Kano, we have an adequate arrangement for their education and for those who cannot find where to go, we are their parents and we are ready to cater for them. “Our intention is to ensure that the Almajiri system is fully integrated with the conventional system of education. Our children have the right to education and Almajiris have right to education.”"

The students also condemned some institutions for closing their online portal for payment of school fees, an act that could lead to extension of academic years of some students.

 The association stated that despite the global pandemic ravaging humanity at this moment, the management of Osun State University closed the institution's portal for payment of fees not minding that many students could not afford to pay now.  “The institution, in reckless display of insensitivity to the plight of students, parents and guardians and in furtherance of its callous and despotic policies, also kick-started e-learning for the negligible few ones who are lucky to have paid and affirming they will go ahead with online e-examination.  “Also in our findings, we are made to understand that  Osun State University is not alone in this display of callousness, OSCOTECH, Esa Oke has also begun e-learning for some of her students not minding those who can't afford to purchase data or having the e-learning facilities (computer and smartphone).  “The cut-throat charges at UNIOSUN has already made the institution unaffordable for average parents in the state, the latest e-learning antic is therefore a complete attack on the people and a bolder step towards the transformation of the university to a stark anti-poor,  pro rich institution. ""We shall fight against this and other obnoxious policies of the university,” the association said. The students' body also urged the Osun State Government to persuade the institutions to reverse their decisions and be considerate in their academic policies. It said, “They are admonished to be considerate and reverse their decisions, first, by putting on hold any form of online study or e-learning for Nigeria students as we have made to understand that not all students are having full access to the facilities (computers and smartphone) and not all those having the facilities can afford datafication of the gadgets presently as a result of the present economic reality. “All tertiary institutions should open and activate their school fees portal till when the schools reopen as most parents are trying to provide for survival with their families presently and can't afford payments of school fees.”"

Politics,How Importation Of 15 Chinese Nationals To 'Help' Coronavirus Fight Exposed Nigerian Government’s Insincerity,"4 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/how-importation-15-chinese-nationals-help-coronavirus-fight-exposed-nigerian-government%E2%80%99s,"Few weeks after wild excitement greeted the arrival of 15 Chinese nationals in Nigeria to help in the fight against Coronavirus in the country, things appear to have taken a different turn.  Before the arrival of the Chinese, various government officials raised the hopes of Nigerians, eloquently projecting that as soon as they touched down in the country, Coronavirus would almost be banished from every nook and cranny especially going by the manner at which China had been able to box the virus to a corner.  But not thrilled by the move to ignore local medical practitioners and go for foreigners, the Nigerian Medical Association described the move as “a thing of embarrassment to the membership of the association and other health workers giving their best in the fight against COVID-19 under deplorable working conditions”. 
 
 Despite the flurry of criticisms from various stakeholders, the Nigerian Government insisted that the arrival of the 15 Chinese, who up until that period were all thought to be doctors, was going to be long awaited game changer in the fight against the deadly virus.  Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, admonished Nigerians to see the arrival of the 15 Chinese as a positive step towards advancing medicine in Nigeria. Shortly after that period, Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, on May 4 said that, “The Chinese are doing well, they all tested negative for Coronavirus. “As to what they are doing right now, they are busy working at our isolation centres, putting together and setting up their equipment they brought. “They are helping our doctors in capacity building in the centres. Like we said at the beginning, none of the Chinese doctors will be treating any patient in Nigeria.” However, a new twist was added to the drama on Thursday when Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, during the daily Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefing, said that he had no idea on the whereabouts of the 15 Chinese imported into the country to help wrestle and defeat Coronavirus. He said, “I want to explain that first of all, I think not all of them are doctors and I heard that some of them are technicians but they are staff of CCECC. “The Ministry of Health is not their host, so we cannot always explain what happened to them or where they are. “There seems to be a lot of interest in these doctors but they are staff of a company. I would be very happy if you do not ask me where they are.” According to observers, the situation has exposed the Nigerian Government’s insincerity in the fight against the pandemic and the cracks within its ranks where officials are already giving different explanation to a single event.  ""They knew from the word go that these guys were not doctors because some of us protested and things we heard showed that it was all arranged,"" a federal lawmaker, who asked not to be named told SaharaReporters. “Government lied to the Nigerian people about the identity of the men because of their corrupt ties to the company. ""There are secret monies, contracts and loans exchanging hands between the presidency, Accountant General's office and Malami who is involved as well. ""They all get kickbacks from CCECC especially from sensitive contracts awarded to them like our airport in Abuja. “China made a request to welcome this people publicly as a show of strength even when there was outrage about the treatment of Nigerians in China. They could not say no because their hands are tied,” he added. Recall that SaharaReporters had on April 10 exclusively reported how the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation single-handedly shipped the 15 Chinese workers into the Nigeria against the widespread belief that the arrival of the doctors was facilitated by the Nigerian Government.  This move by the construction firm, according to findings by SaharaReporters, was to properly cement its place in the Nigerian system where a lot of contracts had been awarded to it by government.  Due to its involvement in some activities with government officials, which led to scandals, CCECC, by bringing in the 15 Chinese workers, was desperately trying to save face especially after eyebrows were raised over its operation in Nigeria. In a letter confirming that it in fact brought in the doctors and medical supplies on its own accord, Micheal Jiang, MD of CCECC in Nigeria, said the move was the company’s way of supporting the country’s fight against the COVID-19. The move by CCECC was to save face and continue to get patronage from the Nigerian Government especially after it was blacklisted by the World Bank over alleged fraud and corruption in 2019. CCECC together with five other Chinese companies was accused of violating the global bank’s procurement guidelines and declared ineligible of receiving any World Bank contracts between June 4, 2019 and March 3, 2020. Before then in July 2018, CCECC had been involved in a scholarships scandal it offered to some Nigerians to study Railway Engineering in China. However, despite these scandals that has trailed the Chinese company in recent times, documents seen by SaharaReporters showed that CCECC remains popular among Nigerian Government officials and has continued to enjoy huge patronage by way of contract awards.  "

Despite an attempt to sell him as a widely experienced diplomat, Gambari has lent his career to assisting Nigerian dictators to oppress citizens through undemocratic acts, judicial murders and large scale corruption.  A few of publicly documented actions directed against democratic progress and abuse of human rights in Nigeria are noteworthy.  In 1995 for instance, he openly backed the killing of Ogoni environmentalist, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and eight other activists during the ruthless General Sani Abacha military regime.
 
 Gambari had informed the United Nations that the killing of Saro-Wiwa was legal as it was done in line with the law and constitution of Nigeria. The UN General Assembly had condemned the arbitrary execution of Saro-Wiwa after a flawed judicial process, emphasising that everyone charged with a penal offence had the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to the law in a public trial with all guarantees necessary for defence. But Gambari accused the UN General Assembly of dancing to the tune of some individuals trying to challenge the sovereignty of Nigeria.  He labelled Saro-Wiwa a “common criminal”, who had engaged in the murder of some Ogoni elders. He said that by the draft resolution, the sovereign right of a member state to enact a law was being challenged and the right to use capital punishment for serious offences was being questioned. The Ilorin, Kwara State-born professor was once quoted as saying, “Nigerians don’t need democracy because democracy is not food. It is not their priority now.”  As more pressure mounted on the Abacha regime from all corners of the world, Gambari became more notorious and ruthless in defending and deflecting attacks against the Abacha dictatorship. As a result of his actions, he was forced to resign as head of a committee organising peace talks between the Nigerian Government and militants in the oil-producing Niger Delta.  Some Niger Delta leaders including MEND rejected Gambari’s involvement in the proposed summit. “My appointment has attracted what appears to be a well orchestrated and relentless opposition from some quarters, institutions, groups and individuals. “As a result, my name has become the issue in place of the attempt at finding a just and lasting solution to the crisis in the Niger Delta.  ""In light of this, I wish to be excused as the chairman of the steering committee of the summit,"" Gambari said in his resignation letter to former President, Umaru Yar’Adua.  Apart from his role in the killing of Saro-Wiwa and the eight Ogoni indigenes, President Buhari's new Chief of Staff is also known to have openly supported the annulment of June 12, 1993 election won by business tycoon, Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola. The military regime of Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida cancelled the outcome of that election overwhelming won by Abiola while the Abacha government arrested and threw him in jail where he remained until he died on July 7, 1998.    "

 Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has purchased Sports Utility Vehicles worth N600m for some traditional rulers in the state, SaharaReporters can confirm.  Buni, who gifted 14 emirs one of the vehicles and a bus each, is owing retired civil servants in the state gratuities running into several billions of naira.  Yobe State has one of the highest poverty rates in Nigeria with 2.2 million people out of its 2.3 million residents living below $1 – N360 – per day. 
 
 The literacy level in the state, which stands at 24.3 per cent, is one of the lowest in the country according to figures from the National Bureau of Statistics. SaharaReporters gathered that instead of fixing the abysmal educational system in the state or compensating retired civil servants, Governor Buni went on the spending spree for the traditional rulers to reward them for convincing their subjects to vote him into power.
 
 ""Look at Government Day Secondary School, Gashua, under Bade Local Government Area for example, the children sit on the floor for lessons while the roof is almost collapsing on their heads,"" a state official told SaharaReporters. Some lawmakers from Yobe, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said the action of the governor was slowing down governance in the state. 
 
 “People are dying, things are not going well. We want the governor to re-evaluate his decisions and prioritize the people,” one of the lawmakers said."

",/2020/05/17/lagos-aac-calls-prosecution-state%E2%80%99s-assembly-speaker-obasa-over-stealing-public-funds,"The Lagos State chapter of the African Action Congress has called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of Mudashiru Obasa, Speaker of the Lagos state House of Assembly. AAC made this call while reacting to SaharaReporters investigative reports exposing the fraudulent and corrupt activities of the Lagos Speaker. In a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Elias Ozikpu, the party on Sunday said Obasa and other politicians had turned the state’s wealth into Automated Teller Machines they could withdraw money from whenever they wanted. The statement reads, “In a series of investigative reporting, the website painstakingly exposed how Mr Obasa, taking advantage of his office as the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, turned into a Father Christmas as he inundates himself and members of his family with financial gifts at the expense of Lagosians. 
 
 “Being a fraudulent regime itself, the Lagos State Government under Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the anti-graft agencies have decided to look the other way as Mr Obasa continues to preside over the state Assembly. What we have deduced from the sustained silence so far is that a criminal cannot be arrested by members of his gang. “The same House of Assembly never deemed it fit to approve palliatives for Lagosians despite the mass hunger and hardships ravaging the state. Even when there was mass insecurity; Speaker Obasa and members of the government cruised around in bullet-proof jeeps. Education; healthcare, and other social infrastructures have disappeared into oblivion. “On a daily basis in Lagos, citizens are arbitrarily arrested, subjected to severe torture and subsequently dumped in prison without trial, whilst the grand thieves are running the affairs of the state. “This same rogues also have a cartel of land grabbers who uses state machinery to steal lands of individuals and communities through illegal demolitions. When people protest; the Obasa-led Assembly lie openly about building mega city through a Bourdillion-carved Lagos master plan. Lagosians are in deep pains; but Obasa and co has turned the state wealth into casual ATM machines. “Consequently, the Lagos chapter of the African Action Congress urges Lagosians to rise in their numbers and demand the immediate arrest and prosecution of the incumbent Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Mr Mudashiru Ajayi Obasa, for his numerous financial crimes against the people of Lagos.”"

",/2020/05/11/new-york-judge-orders-10-united-states-banks-release-documents-relating-money-laundering,"A New York federal judge has ruled that Nigeria can subpoena 10 banks in the United States for information the country needs to prosecute government officials allegedly connected to a British Virgin Island engineering firm's bribery scheme and subsequent $9.6bn arbitral claim, according to law360.com. The Nigerian Government had last month asked the court to compel the banks to release account details of former President, Goodluck Jonathan, his wife, Patience, former ministers of Petroleum Resources, Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke and Rilwanu Lukman. The banks listed include Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and New York branches of Deutsche Bank AG and United Bank for Africa Plc. 
 
 Nigeria is requesting “all documents concerning any transactions to, from, or for the benefit” of Jonathan and his wife between 2009 and this day. District Judge, Lorna Schofield, who gave the ruling, ordered the banks to allow the Nigerian Government have access to the account details to enable it prove that the $9.6bn arbitration was obtained by Process and Industrial Development by fraud. According to court documents, the Nigerian Government is seeking the bank documents to help an ongoing investigation by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to know individuals in the Process and Industrial Developments Ltd gas deal, especially the roles of Lukman and Alison-Madueke. It said the 10 banks are “likely to have processed US dollar transactions connected to P&ID’s operations as either correspondent banks or the New York branches of foreign lenders”. It however, said it had yet to find “direct evidence” that Jonathan, Alison-Madueke and other politicians received payments from P&ID or its affiliates. The Nigerian Government said Lukman during his time as minister signed the contract while Alison-Madueke was responsible for the “flagrant mishandling” of government’s arbitration strategy until 2015."
Insurgency,"Hold Northern Governors, Elites Responsible For Resurgence Of Insecurity In North –Shehu Sani","3 Hours Ago
",/2020/05/17/hold-northern-governors-elites-responsible-resurgence-insecurity-north-%E2%80%93shehu-sani,"Northern governors and political elites have been accused of being responsible for the upsurge in killings and kidnappings going on in Kastina, Kaduna and Plateau states. Armed bandits and insurgents had few days ago unleashed mayhem and burnt down villages in these states, killing many people including women and children. Speaking on the issue, a former federal lawmaker from Kaduna State, Shehu Sani, told SaharaReporters that the silence of governors and political elites to tell truth to power on the deplorable security situation in the Northern region was the cause of the recent killings in the area. Sani said the governors of the region had misled President Muhammadu Buhari into believing that his administration had achieved much in the North when in actual sense the average citizen thinks worse of his government. 
 
 He said, ""The bombing and killings under Jonathan administration have turned to a joke with regard to what is happening today in the country.” He revealed that the entire Birni Gwari and part of Igabi local government area in Kaduna State were currently under the siege and control of bandits. Sani state, “The political leaders and governors of North-West are afraid of telling truth to power to avoid being tagged as anti-Buhari. They have kept mute because they don't want to be the enemy of the President. ""The North is in the grip of insurgents that have knocked down the Nigerian Army. People have sold their houses and farmlands in order to pay ransom. ""The governors and security agents have failed to protect our people and this is a sign of a failing state. ""There is a systematic attempt to bring an end to certain towns and villages in Kajuri with these kind of killings.  ""I can tell you in one village alone (Kirawa) in Igabi Local Government Area, in one day, 60 people were massacred."" 
 
 The former lawmaker from Kaduna commended the resilience and fearlessness of Prof Ango Abdullahi and Balarabe Musa, an ex-governor of Kaduna State, as only political leaders in the North, who have been raising their voices to speak against the grievous and tragic situation in the region. Sani chided President Buhari for failing to arrest the security challenge in the country since he came into office, saying that he should have changed the service chiefs long ago to address insecurity. He called for the convocation of a security conference in the Northern region that would involve retired officers of the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police Force and Department of State Services with a view to finding lasting solution to the problem.

CRIME,EXCLUSIVE: Real Reason I was Assaulted –FUTA Student Brutalised By Colleagues,"6 Months Ago
",/2019/11/19/exclusive-real-reason-i-was-assaulted-%E2%80%93futa-student-brutalised-colleagues,"
 
 Boluwatife Adekunle, the female undergraduate of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State, who was physically assaulted by two ladies and a guy all said to be student of the institution, has given more insight into why she was attacked. The young lady, who says she wants justice served, told SaharaReporters on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital, that she was attacked by her colleagues for revealing how one of their boyfriends forcefully tried to have an affair with her. Adekunle revealed that she was assaulted in one of the private hostels outside the school campus by the group in a bid to be disgraced among fellow students. She said, “The whole issue started few weeks ago. I and one of the ladies in the video called 'Faith' were roommates in a hostel outside campus. “Her boyfriend began asking me out but I felt it was not proper for me to date him. I rejected his advances. “But instead of him to leave me alone, the guy kept disturbing me, so I had to report him to Faith because I don't want trouble.
 
 “Before then, I had been having some issues with Faith as she had been living a wayward life on campus which I didn't like. “From that point, she started seeing me as talking bad about her to people around our area. “During this period, her boyfriend kept pestering me to date him but I refused. “Instead of Faith to caution her boyfriend, she accused me of planning to sleep with her man. “On the day that I was assaulted, she invited me to a room in one of the hostels and boyfriend and other ladies were inside the place already. “Immediately I entered the place, they locked the door and asked me to kneel down while the guy was asking if he ever asked me for a date. “Since I refused to kneel down, they began to beat me and also tried to strip me naked. “They used a stick to hit me on my head and punched me on my face. The guy used horse whip to flog me several times. “They said they would make sure they disgraced me on campus, I pleaded with them but they refused and I was about to faint when they stopped beating me. “As I speak, I feel pains all over my body due to the beatings. Their plan was to kill me. I want them arrested and face the consequences of their action.” While condemning the attack on her daughter, the victim’s mother, Mrs Florence Adekunle, said they wanted justice over the matter. She said, “I was in the church on Sunday when her brother called me that they saw Boluwatife in a video and she was beaten up. “I can't imagine how friends would treat a fellow student like this. I'm aware that the school authority and even the police have taken up the matter, all the same we want justice.” Following the incident and the widespread criticism that greeted it, the management of FUTA had announced the indefinite suspension on the students seen in the viral video assaulting Boluwatife. Spokesperson for the institution, Adegbenro Adebanjo, confirmed this in a statement in Akure on Monday. He identified the names of those suspended as Popoola Olaniyi Agboola (300L), Oluwadare Faith Tobiloba (200L), Nandi Yohanna Jessica (200L), Ajuwon Tolani Emmanuella (100L), Emmanuel Funmilayo Taiwo (100L) and Alao Olabimpe Cecilia (100L). According to him, the university would not tolerate any form of indiscipline among students of the institution. Adebanjo said, “As a consequence of their suspension, they are precluded from all academic and related activities indefinitely and barred from the university and its precincts forthwith. “At the conclusion of ongoing investigations, the law of the university as contained in the handbook and oath of matriculation which all students are made to sign and subscribe to, will be visited on those found culpable.” Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Adie Undie, told SaharaReporters that all the students involved would be invited for interrogation. He said, “We have started investigation on the matter. I have asked my men to brief me continuously on the findings.”"

He said, “Pumping money into school feeding programme while schools are not open is a little absurd. It is a redundant, unworkable palliative. 
 
 “In a nation where there is no standard numbering of houses, how do you get the food to the beneficiaries? This is more than laughable.

While in the opposition in 2012, Pantami heavily criticised the handling of insurgency in Nigeria's North-East by former President, Goodluck Jonathan.  He also said in an opinion piece published on an online news platform that ""leadership in Nigeria has failed"" and called on Nigerians to ""rise up"" and change the situation.

",/2020/05/17/lawyers-ask-efcc-arrest-probe-lagos-speaker-obasa-over-corruption-allegation,"The Coalition of Public Interests Lawyers and Advocates has asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to probe allegations of financial impropriety and grand corruption against Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa. SaharaReporters has in a series of reports revealed how Obasa and his allies in the House appropriated public funds to personal accounts illegally.  COPA in a statement on Sunday signed by its National Coordinator, Pelumi Olajengbesi, and Chairman Anti-corruption Network, Patrick Odey, said the EFCC must live up to its responsibility of probing allegations of corruption against public servants without being reminded. The statement reads, ""It is a gross understatement to proceed with the reminder that the EFCC, an anti-graft institution, is statutorily bound to investigate and cause a prosecution into all and any action involving public stealing, looting, and or other financial crimes especially amongst public officers who hold in equity the keys to the vault of the commonwealth of our society and we hereby demand that EFCC should leave up to its foundation objectives. 
 
 ""One Rt. Hon. Mudashiru A. Obasa, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, has in recent weeks come under intense public scrutiny and opprobrium over severe allegations of the abuse of his office to loot the treasury of Lagos State dry, and some of this allegations are reproduced hereunder for immediate action by the EFCC.  ""That Hon. Obasa approved the sum of N258m (N258, 000 000.00) for the printing of invitation cards for the inauguration of lawmakers two months after the event had been held in a document titled “Celebrations and Ceremonies"" (LSHA/LM/C/276), and dated August 7, 2019 for the inauguration of the Ninth Assembly with 34 returning members and six new members, which held on June 7, 2019. 
 
 ""That Hon. Obasa allegedly fraudulently approved for himself the sum of N17m (N17, 000 000.00) as monthly maintenance allowance for his personal residence and guest house, while also exploiting his position as Speaker of the House of Assembly Lagos State to cause the sum of N10m (N10, 000 000.00) to be paid to his wife on a fictitious initiative.  ""That the sum of N58m (N58, 000 000.00) was also allegedly cleverly misappropriated by Hon. Obasa from the Lagos State coffers to fund a private trip and spree to the United States of America with his mistress.  ""Sub-paragraphs 1-3 above detail gross criminal allegations which call for the most urgent attention by Nigeria’s go-to anti-graft agency, the EFCC whose foot-dragging or reluctance to act may very well defeat the purpose of its creation, and further reward a highly suspect case of theft of public resources while casting aspersions on the integrity of the agency. 
 
 ""There are fears in the public space since the unfolding revelations into Obasagate, so termed, that his affiliation to state and federal powers, particularly his membership of the ruling party, may tilt events in his favour as such persons are habitually conceived as sacred cows beyond the punitive reach of the law.  ""COPA would like to borrow its confidence to EFCC to treat as urgent and with no considerations for the person involved, the allegations which has been levelled against Hon. Obasa as it borders on betrayal of public confidence, abuse of official power, outright corruption and the embezzlement of public fund for private use. Such allegations strongly question the morality and integrity of the Lagos State Speaker and only a thorough investigation and perhaps a prosecution on available facts can fairly provide him with the opportunity to clear his name if possible."" COPA said the EFCC must arrest Obasa and probe the allegations, failure of which will force the group to take legal action against the anti-graft agency. ""We demand the immediate arrest, investigation and consequent prosecution of Hon. Obasa, Lagos State Assembly Speaker, for gross misconduct in office, economic crime, fraud and extortion of state resources.  “No stones must be left unturned as only a thorough and impartial investigation into the dawning allegations against the Speaker whose dishonourable actions may have further impoverished the state and starved other areas of government interventions of fund can acquit this agency and satisfy public outcry for justice.  ""Take notice that if EFCC should fail to accede to our demand within a reasonable time we shall leverage on our reach with the civil society groups within and without, and exert all media and legal means to compel the Commission to discharge its statutory duty in respect of this demand."""

Exclusive,"EXCLUSIVE: Lagos Assembly Speaker, Obasa, Fraudulently Collected N53m For Travel With Mistress To United States","3 Days Ago
",/2020/05/14/exclusive-lagos-assembly-speaker-obasa-fraudulently-collected-n53m-travel-mistress-united,"In another misuse of public funds and abuse of office, Speaker of Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, received N53m from the state coffers to travel with his mistress to the United States of America. Obasa got the House to approve the fund to facilitate a trip to Georgia, United States, for the 2019 US-Nigeria Trade and Investment Global Summit, which he was billed to attend with some members of the Assembly and their staff. The event was subsequently postponed but rather than return the fund to the state’s treasury, Obasa diverted the funds for personal use as he travelled to the United States with his mistress. In a document sighted by SaharaReporters dated October 15, 2019, Obasa had requested the Assembly to release the funds so he could attend the summit along with one of his staff. 
 
 The document reads partly, “Given the above, kindly seek approval of the Rt. Hon. Speaker for release of the sum of N53,719,405 only to enable them to attend the programme. “Hon. Speaker, please read from page 39 of file. You are respectfully invited to consider and approve the release of N53,719,405 to facilitate the attendance of the Hon. Speaker, Hon. members and one member of staff at the Y2019 US – Nigeria Trade and Investment Global Summit scheduled to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, from 26th – 28th September 2019.”
 
 It was gathered that though the meeting was rescheduled, Obasa travelled to the US with his mistress in place of his legislative staff. An official of the Lagos Assembly, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said the Speaker was always in the habit of travelling with his mistress in place of his staff whenever he was leaving the country for official purpose. “The Speaker and his mistress, who doubles as his protocol and external relations officer in the Assembly, only went to the US after collecting N53m for the US-Nigeria Trade and Investment Global Summit. “No other staff or member of the Assembly travelled with the Speaker or attended the event,” the source said.
 
 
 
 Another person close to the Speaker’s team also confirmed the lamentation and anger of some of the staff listed on this approval, who couldn’t embark on the trip or got a share of the money. They swore to “spill the beans if invited by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission as there were no visas on their international passports to defend the trip”. One of the Assembly's staff hinted that only Folajimi Lai Mohammed travelled to the US at the time Obasa and his mistress jetted out to America. “It could not be confirmed if he did on the bill of the N53m largess since names were not attached to the requisition to tell who benefited,” another source in the Lagos Assembly privy to the release of the fund, said.

 The last few days have been tough periods for sports around the world. Since the global pandemic – Coronavirus – took an even deadlier dimension, ravaging households and entire communities across dozens of countries around the world, a growing number of sporting events have been cancelled while scores more have been allowed to go ahead in completely empty venues. This is in an attempt to reduce the spread of the ruthless virus that has killed more than 4,000 persons in over 70 countries. For instance, on Thursday the National Basketball Association in the United States announced that all matches will be suspended until further notice, after Utah Jazz player, Rudy Gobert, tested positive to the virus. Shortly afterwards, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both in the United States, announced the stoppage of their respective seasons due to the outbreak and spread of Coronavirus. In Europe where football is almost like a tradition and in fact a religion, the virus has caused unprecedented damage, forcing major matches to be staged in empty venues and in some occasions completely suspended.  On Friday, the Union of European Football Association suspended all Champions League and Europa League matches billed for next week over the Coronavirus outbreak. On the same day, the English Premier League suspended all fixtures until April 4 after Arsenal Football Club manager, Mikel Arteta, and Chelsea winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, both tested positive to Coronavirus. Despite the attendant loss in revenue for sports federations and professional clubs in places where games had been played behind closed doors and or suspended, authorities had placed public safety ahead of every other consideration.  In Nigeria, the deadly virus was detected after an Italian imported it into the country on February 24, 2020. The man, who arrived the country aboard a Turkish Airlines flight, visited Ogun and Lagos and had contact with several persons, increasing the possibility of a further spread of the virus in the country.  Though health authorities have been working to ensure Coronavirus does not spread further in Nigeria, the fears remain valid.  During visits to some Nigerian Premier Leagues match venues last weekend by SaharaReporters correspondents to ascertain the level of precautionary measures being put in place to protect players, coaching staff and fans against the virus and other transmittable diseases, it was observed that basic protective items like hand sanitisers, hand wash, nose masks were all missing, exposing everyone at such venues to danger of being infected with all kinds of diseases.  For example, during a visit to the Agege Stadium in Lagos where the fixture between MFM FC and Enugu Rangers was played on Sunday evening, it was observed that there was no preventive measure in place at the stadium to protect players, officials and fans of both clubs.  This laxity can be observed right from the main gate of the stadium as visitors to the sports arena walked into the place without sanitising their hands or protecting themselves in any way.  Officials searched fans trooping into the stadium with bare hands, exposing themselves and even visitors to all kinds of germs and transmittable diseases. At the ticket section stationed outside the stadium, it was also observed that sale attendants lacked protective gears and went about their assignments as usual without recourse to the deadly virus currently ravaging many parts of the world especially places where people gathered in large numbers. Speaking with SaharaReporters shortly after the match between MFM FC and Enugu Rangers, Akinola Oriyomi, Manager of Agege Stadium, said that the absence of hand sanitisers at the venue was because the government was yet to provide it. “My work is to make the stadium clean and I am doing that.  “About hand sanitisers, I don’t think it’s my work to provide them to the stadium for spectators. “I'm a civil servant, I can't use my money to buy hand sanitisers for people coming into the stadium. “The government has to provide it, when they do, it would be made available for spectators to use.” It was the same situation in Akure, Ondo State, when SaharaReporters visited the stadium in the city to observe the match between Sunshine stars of Akure and Abia Warriors last Sunday evening.  Management of the Akure Stadium failed to put precautionary measures in place to protect both players and spectators against Coronavirus during the encounter as observed by our correspondent.  At the front of the two gates leading into the stadium, it was observed that no hand sanitiser was put place while other safety measures to prevent spectators from contracting the disease were also absent. A military personnel stationed at the gate of the stadium was seen checking pockets and bags of fans entering the stadium to watch the match with bare hands.  At the ticketing office of the stadium, it was also observed that the attendants were not protected nor guided by any safety kits as some of them even shook hands freely with fans going in to watch the match – thus increasing the chances of the spread of the deadly virus.  Our correspondent also noticed that no ambulance or other medical equipment where in place to attend to emergency cases inside the stadium in case any such situation. The situation was not also different at the swimming pool section of the stadium where children were seen swimming and playing around without any precautionary measure in place. Like in other sections of the facility visited, there are no hand sanitisers, hand wash and nose masks in place at this area. The rot at the Akure Stadium was further confirmed when our correspondent visited the toilets and bathrooms inside the facility. Apart from the offensive odour permeating that section of the sports arena, the presence of maggots and other crawling creatures spoke volumes of how unhygienic the facility was – the perfect ground for transmittable diseases like Coronavirus. An official in the stadium, who spoke with SaharaReporters, said although the authorities of the facility were aware of the spread of the virus, they were not ready at ensuring it does not find its way into the state. “The stadium is really crowded and we hardly know who is who but there is no protective measures in place. “God forbid that Coronavirus comes to this place, only God knows how many people would be infected because there is nothing to protect them here,” the official said.  It was the same scenario at the other match venues of the Nigerian Premier League visited by SaharaReporters correspondent on Sunday. At some venues, basic items like first aid boxes were non-existed while ambulances to ferry players, officials and fans to hospital for treatment in case of medical emergencies were missing. Interestingly, Nigeria’s Premier League is ranked 57th strongest national league in the world as at 2019 by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics. It is the seventh strongest league in Africa behind those of Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Angola, South Africa and Zambia. The Nigeria Football Federation appears helpless about the situation, sadly, raising fears of a disaster in case of further spread of the virus in the country. "
